fter returning home and preparing himself, Haruto visited the Tojo household, which he was starting to get more familiar with. The grand entrance of the impressive mansion was as majestic as ever. Haruto pressed the intercom button, and a response came almost immediately.

"Yes, yes! Is this Otsuki-kun?"

"Yes, it's Otsuki. I'm here for the housework," Haruto replied.

"I’ve been waiting! Ryota, your big brother’s here! Go open the door! Oh, and Otsuki-kun, Ryota is unlocking the door right now, so please wait a moment."

"Thank you very much."

Just as Haruto finished saying his thanks, the front door swung open energetically.

"Big brother!" Ryota shouted excitedly.

"Hey, Ryota-kun. Hello!"

"Hello! Big brother, hurry! The fish is amazing!" Ryota, bubbling with excitement, grabbed Haruto’s hand and dragged him into the living room.

"Welcome, Otsuki-kun."

As Haruto stepped into the living room, Ikue, Ayaka’s mother, stood up from the sofa, beaming with a smile as she greeted him.

"Thank you for having me."

"Hey! Otsuki-kun! So glad you could come!" Shuichi, Ayaka’s father, followed up with a warm welcome. There was a large cooler box at his feet. Haruto, glancing at it, spoke up.

"I heard from Ayaka... that you caught a yellowtail, a sea bream, and a Spanish mackerel, Mr. Shuichi."

Upon hearing this, Shuichi’s face lit up with excitement, as if saying, ‘You’ve been listening!’

"That's right! A guy from a client of mine loves recreational fishing, and we often go out on the boat together. Today was a great catch! When I hooked this yellowtail, I thought it was just snagged on the bottom at first! It wouldn’t budge no matter how much I reeled it in! But finally, when I got it within twenty meters, it started thrashing around, and the drag was flying out like crazy. It was a real battle! It took me about fifteen—no, thirty minutes to reel it in!" Shuichi excitedly recounted.

"Sweetheart? You’re talking too much, and the freshness of the fish will start to drop!" Ikue interrupted, seeing Haruto’s amused expression.

"Ah, yes, you’re right. These fish are so fresh, we need to start preparing them quickly," Ikue added.

"Alright, leave it to me," Haruto replied with a chuckle, nodding as he prepared to start working.

"These are some great-sized fish, aren’t they? This sea bream looks to be just the right size to taste the best, right?"

Looking at the cooler box, Haruto asked. Immediately, Shuichi, eager to explain, started speaking again.

"Oh, this sea bream too! At first, I thought the line was just going slack a bit, but when I quickly set the hook, it fought like crazy, and I managed to land it without losing it!"

"Oh... right... Otsuki-kun, could you go ahead and prepare the fish?" Shuichi said, slightly deflated after Ikue cut him off.

"Shall we bring this cooler box to the kitchen first?" Haruto suggested, his sympathy for Shuichi’s eagerness to tell the fishing story clear in his expression.

Haruto grabbed the cooler box handle, but the weight was much heavier than he expected. His face twisted in surprise.

"I’ll take the other side," Ikue offered.

"Oh, thank you! That helps."

The yellowtail was about 70 cm long, the Spanish mackerel around 60 cm, and the sea bream was roughly 40 to 50 cm. With ice inside, the cooler box was a bit too heavy for Haruto to carry alone comfortably, but with both him and Shuichi lifting it together, they made their way to the kitchen.

"Thank you so much, that really helped. Now, shall we start preparing them? Do you have any specific requests for how you want them cooked?" Haruto asked.

Just as Haruto finished speaking, the door to the living room opened and Ayaka entered.

"Ah, Otsuki-kun, you’re here. Welcome," she greeted.

"Ah, yes. Um... I’m sorry for intruding," Haruto responded.

The earlier events at the home center still lingered in both of their minds, and they exchanged somewhat awkward greetings. Ikue, noticing the subtle changes in their behavior, looked at her daughter with amusement.

"W-what?" Ayaka asked, noticing her mother’s gaze.

"Well, Otsuki-kun is going to prepare some lovingly made dishes for us. Ayaka, what would you like?" Ikue asked playfully, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.

"Love? That, uh... that's not something you can just tell," Ayaka responded with a frown to her mother’s comment. In response, Ikue, clearly entertained, turned her gaze to Haruto this time.

"Oh, I can tell! Right, Otsuki-kun? The reason your cooking is so delicious isn’t just because you're skilled, but because you put lots of love into it, right?"

"Uh, well... yes, um... I put my heart into it, sincerely," Haruto replied.

"See? Otsuki-kun is cooking with love just for you, Ayaka!"

"Well, um... not just for Ayaka-san, but for everyone..."

"Oh my! Otsuki-kun, you're such a kind soul," Ikue teased.

"No, not really..." Haruto responded, forcing a smile while realizing that Ikue was undoubtedly the most formidable member of the Tojo family.

"Hey, hey, big bro, I want to eat sashimi!" Ryota, sensing an opening while Haruto was being playfully teased by Ikue, eagerly put in his request. Seeing this as a chance to escape Ikue’s antics, Haruto crouched down to meet Ryota’s gaze.

"Alright, I'll make sashimi from all three types of fish."

"Yay!" Ryota cheered gleefully. Shuichi nodded in agreement.

"Yes, freshly caught fish should definitely be enjoyed as sashimi. After all, we Japanese appreciate it the most."

"Understood. In that case, tonight’s dinner will include sashimi platters of yellowtail, sea bream, and Spanish mackerel. Ikue-san, Ayaka-san, is that alright with you both?" Haruto asked.

"Yes, of course!"

"I’d love to have sashimi too," Ayaka added.

With everyone in the Tojo family on board, Haruto promptly began preparing the fish. Just then, Shuichi entered the kitchen holding a plastic bag.

"Oh, by the way, Otsuki-kun. Since I was planning on having you make sashimi, I went ahead and bought some useful tools and vegetables."

"Really? May I take a look inside?"

Haruto took the plastic bag from Shuichi and checked its contents. Inside, he found a fish scaler, a julienne peeler perfect for preparing daikon radish garnish, as well as various vegetables like carrots, radish, cucumber, and shiso leaves that would enhance the presentation.

"Thank you, Shuichi-san. With all this, the sashimi platters will look even more colorful."

As Haruto expressed his gratitude, Ikue gave Shuichi a teasing smile.

"This guy here went and bought all these things, yet he forgot the most important thing— wasabi."

"Hahaha, yeah... I really messed up there," Shuichi admitted, scratching the back of his head sheepishly.

Now understanding why Ayaka had gone to the store just to buy wasabi, Haruto felt a sense of clarity.

"Alright, let's get started," Haruto announced.

He began by placing the yellowtail on the cutting board, holding its tail as he gently washed it with water before using the fish scaler to remove the scales. Once the scales were off, he cut off the head, removed the gills, opened the belly, took out the innards, and then proceeded to fillet the fish into three sections.

Watching as Haruto swiftly turned the yellowtail into fillets, Shuichi couldn't help but express his admiration.

"You’ve really got a great touch. It’s satisfying to watch you work."

"Thank you. Honestly, I haven’t had many chances to fillet such large, magnificent fish before, so I was worried if I could handle it properly. But thanks to this tool, it’s been a smooth process."

“Oh, this knife...” Haruto lifted the deba knife he was holding, showing it off a bit. The knife, which belonged to the Tojo family, had a name engraved near its base, giving it an air of high quality. Its sharpness was exceptional, allowing him to handle even a large fish like the yellowtail, with its tough bones, without any trouble.

After filleting all the fish into three sections, Haruto carefully removed the bloodline bones and shaved off the belly bones to make the fish easier to eat.

"Wow, that's impressive. Maybe I should learn how to fillet fish from you, Otsuki-kun," Ikue said from the dining table, peeking into the kitchen.

"If you're alright with me teaching you, I’d be happy to," Haruto replied as he peeled the skin off the filleted fish.

"Really? Then, maybe I’ll ask you to teach me sometime. Ayaka, why don’t you join me? It could come in handy when you prepare fish for your future husband."

"Wh-What? I, um..." Ayaka stammered, clearly flustered. Ikue, with a sly grin, leaned in.

"Don’t want to? Oh, but if someone like Otsuki-kun becomes your husband, it wouldn’t be a problem, right?"

"Hey! Mom! What are you saying with Otsuki-kun right here?!" Ayaka’s face turned red at her mother’s sudden and embarrassing remark.

Ikue, however, remained unfazed. "Oh, I just said 'someone like Otsuki-kun,' that’s all."

"...I hate you, Mom," Ayaka pouted, clearly upset, while Ikue continued to tease her daughter, looking highly amused.

Turning back to Haruto, Ikue said, "Sorry if my daughter has misunderstood anything, Otsuki-kun. Ayaka can be a bit naïve, but please continue to get along with her."

"Ahaha, I’ll do my best," Haruto responded with a light laugh, noticing Ayaka’s pouty demeanor and deciding to play it safe by giving a neutral answer. It seemed Ayaka’s silent protest wasn’t reaching her mother at all.

Meanwhile, Shuichi, with a serious expression, suddenly spoke up while stroking his chin. "Hmm... so if Ayaka marries Otsuki-kun, he’ll become my son-in-law... my own son, in a way... That’s... acceptable, I suppose. But still, letting go of my precious daughter..."

Lost in his own thoughts, Shuichi mumbled to himself, visibly torn. The moment her father started drifting into this strange monologue, Ayaka’s earlier objections to her mother were completely forgotten. She turned sharply towards Shuichi, alarmed.

"Dad! Stop imagining weird things on your own!"

Unlike Ikue’s playful teasing, Shuichi’s words carried a hint of sincerity, causing Ayaka to panic. She hurriedly tried to pull her father back from the depths of his thoughts. But just then, an innocent yet troublesome interruption appeared.

"Big brother, are you going to marry big sister?" Ryota asked, his eyes wide with curiosity.

“Wha—?! N-No, that’s not—”

“Hey, Ryota! Don’t distract Otsuki-kun while he’s holding a knife! It’s dangerous!” Ayaka scolded as she pulled her younger brother away from watching Haruto’s knife skills up close.

“But if big brother marries big sister, then he’ll be my real big brother, right?” Ryota’s eyes sparkled as he seemed to imagine the possibilities. Ayaka, unable to handle Ryota’s innocent gaze, looked away.

“N-No way! We’re still high school students!”

“Oh my, then you’ll get married after graduation?” Ikue chimed in again, amused.

“Mom, please just be quiet!”

For a while, the Tojo household was caught up in a chaotic debate over whether there would be a marriage or not. Sensing the escalating chaos and realizing it was better not to get involved, Haruto focused on preparing the fish to avoid getting dragged into the conversation.

Eventually, once he finished, Haruto brought a large platter of sashimi to the dining table.

“Um... I’ve finished the sashimi platter...”

Haruto, carrying the platter somewhat hesitantly, approached the dining table, only to find the Tojo family still in a state of utter chaos. Shuichi was lost in serious contemplation, Ryota continued to pester Ayaka about marriage, and Ayaka, her face flushed, was desperately denying it. Meanwhile, Ikue found the entire situation highly entertaining, occasionally throwing in playful comments.

Haruto, trying to gauge the atmosphere, spoke up quietly, “I’ve also made some yellowtail soup, so please enjoy it together.”

※

As soon as I returned to my room, I dove onto my bed with a sigh.

"Ahhh... I'm exhausted..." I muttered, collapsing onto the mattress and letting out a deep breath.

"I couldn't even savor Otsuki-kun's cooking..." Despite the beautiful sashimi platter he made from the fish Dad caught, and the delicious-looking seared Spanish mackerel he prepared using that gas burner we bought from the hardware store, I had no time to actually enjoy any of it. With Dad, Mom, and Ryota all getting carried away, there was no chance to relax and appreciate the meal.

“And then there’s that promise with Otsuki-kun about going to the zoo... what should I do?”

We had made plans at the hardware store, but I couldn’t find a good moment to bring it up while he was here today. The house was way too chaotic, and I was too busy trying to rein in my family’s antics. Before I knew it, our scheduled time was up, and Otsuki-kun had to leave without us having a proper conversation.

"But then again, if I’d brought up going to the zoo, my family would’ve gotten even more out of control, wouldn’t they...?" I could practically see Mom grinning ear to ear, teasing me. Though, honestly, I could probably handle that. Or... maybe not. But at least I’d manage.

Ryota would definitely be overjoyed, but that’s not really a problem.

The biggest issue? Dad.

Dad’s completely taken a liking to Otsuki-kun. Sure, Mom’s fond of him too, but Dad’s practically serious about wanting to make him his son-in-law. Just earlier, during dinner, he was eagerly inviting Otsuki-kun to go fishing together next time.

"Ahhh! Enough already! I’m still just a high school student!!"

I buried my face into my pillow and let out a muffled scream. Marriage, son-in-law, all that stuff—it's way too early for me to even think about! Sure, maybe someone like Otsuki-kun, who’s kind and great at household chores, might be an ideal husband... but—

“No, no, what am I even thinking?!”

I shook my head vigorously, trying to reset my thoughts. My family's opinion of Otsuki-kun keeps getting higher, and it feels like the groundwork is being laid around me. But that’s not even the main issue.

The real problem is something else... something more serious.

Before summer break started—though I’ve already forgotten his name—some upperclassman called me out over the school PA system to propose. I was just mortified. I wanted to run away from that scene as fast as I could. The idea of marriage? Unthinkable. Getting engaged while still in high school? That senior had to be out of his mind.

But... if it were with Otsuki-kun...

When Dad was calling him my future son-in-law, and Ryota was asking me, "Are you going to marry him?" I ended up imagining it. I could actually picture it—a life where I’m living under the same roof with Otsuki-kun.

Yeah, the most serious issue isn’t my family’s antics—it’s my own feelings.

Mom teasing me about Otsuki-kun, Ryota wanting him to be his real big brother, and Dad genuinely liking him... none of that... I don’t really hate it.

Somewhere deep down, I was happy to see how easily Otsuki-kun was fitting into my family.

“...I should talk to Saki about this.”

I pulled out my phone and opened the chat window with my best friend. It was just past ten at night, so she was probably still awake.

I pressed the call button, watching the screen as the name "Aizawa Saki" appeared. The call connected in just a few seconds.

"Nyaaa~" came Saki’s playful greeting.

"Saki, um... I’ve got something I need to talk about..." I said hesitantly.

"Ooh? What’s this, what’s this? Love troubles, perhaps?" she teased. My heart skipped a beat at her words.

"...Maybe," I mumbled.

"...Huh? Wait, seriously?! No way! For real?!"

Her voice erupted from the other end, followed by the sound of something crashing loudly.

"Whoa, Saki? Are you okay?"

"Of course not! What do you mean, Ayaka has love troubles?!"

"Calm down, okay? Let’s just take a deep breath, alright?"

"Calm down? I can’t calm down at all! Wait, wait... is this about that Kaitou-senpai guy? Have you been secretly worrying about him since then?"

Even though it was late at night, her voice was so excited it was practically squeaking. Kaitou-senpai? Who’s that again...? Oh, right—the guy from before summer break who confessed to me over the school broadcast.

"No, it’s got nothing to do with that," I clarified.

"Really? Then who is it? Who’s the lucky guy that stole Ayaka’s heart?!"

"Well, it’s not exactly like he’s stolen it yet..."

Yeah, I’m not exactly in love... probably.

"You remember, Saki? That thing you said before..."

"Huh? Something I said? What did I say?" she asked, clearly confused.

"You know... about how someone would be a good match for me or whatever..."

My face flushed as I struggled to say his name out loud.

"Hmm? A good match... Oh! You mean Otsuki-kun?"

The moment his name came through my phone, my heart skipped a beat.

"...Yeah," I admitted.

"No way! Seriously?! Wait, hold on... but it’s summer break, right? How did things even get to this point with Otsuki-kun?"

"Well, you know... a lot happened..."

"Ugh, spill it already! I need to know all about this ‘a lot’ that happened!"

I couldn’t help but smile a little at Saki’s eager reaction. So, I explained to her how I met Otsuki-kun. The moment I finished, her excited voice nearly made my phone’s speaker crack.

"What?! That’s amazing! It’s like a real-life romance manga! I mean, who has that kind of coincidence?! No one! It’s totally fate! And Otsuki-kun’s skills are just off the charts! Seriously, I can’t handle it!"

"Otsuki-kun’s cooking is really delicious," I said, trying to stay composed.

"Oh-ho! Is that a hint of bragging I hear?"

"No, it’s not! I’m trying to get your advice here!"

"Advice? On how to confess to him?" she teased.

Her words made my face burn up to my ears. The heat I felt was definitely not just from the afterglow of my bath.

"No, it’s not about confessing... it’s that... I don’t even know how I feel about him. I’m not sure if I really like Otsuki-kun or not. That’s what I want to talk to you about."

"..........................."

After I said that, Saki went completely silent. There was no response at all.

Wait, did she fall asleep? I was seriously starting to worry when she finally spoke up.

"Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Ayaka, you’ve always avoided boys. Even if you wanted to fall in love, you couldn’t really get there, could you? No wonder you don’t know what those feelings are like."

She sounded like she had come to some sort of realization. Was it just me, or did she sound like she was pitying me?

"What do you mean by that? What kind of feelings?"

"Well, you know... it’s too much to explain over the phone. How about we meet up tomorrow?"

"Huh? Too much to explain? I can totally meet tomorrow, but... wait, you can’t tell me now?"

It felt like Saki was deliberately dragging this out.

"I’ll give you all the time you need and listen to you properly tomorrow. How about 11 a.m. at our usual café?"

"Uh, okay... that’s fine, but... hey, can’t you just tell me now? What is it that I don’t understand?"

"Well, well, see you tomorrow then."

"Wait, Saki? Saki?! ...She hung up."

I stared at my phone in disbelief. What exactly did she mean? What is it that I don’t understand?

I guess I’ll just have to wait until tomorrow...

I stared at my phone, which had returned to the chat screen, debating whether or not to call Saki back. But knowing her, she’d probably just dodge my questions with her usual playful evasiveness.

After considering my best friend’s personality, which I’ve known so well for years, I sighed and gave up. Instead, I set my phone down on the bedside table.

“What is it... that I don’t understand?” I wondered aloud.

As I lay there, gazing up at my bedroom ceiling, I couldn’t stop thinking about what Saki had said to me earlier. Her words kept looping in my mind, leaving me in a haze of confusion and frustration.

※

The sunlight streaming through the curtains makes me squint and turn my face away.

“Ugh... so sleepy…”

I check the time on my phone beside my pillow.

“Seven o’clock… I have to get up…”

Last night, after the call with Saki, I ended up thinking about so many things that I couldn’t fall asleep. By the time I dozed off, the sky was already starting to brighten, so I hardly got any rest. But since I have plans to meet Saki today, I really need to get up and start getting ready to go out.

I force myself to sit up in bed, and as if protesting, my body releases a massive yawn. It feels like the bed has this magnetic pull trying to drag me back, but with firm resolve, I pry myself away and head to the bathroom.

A splash of cold water on my face makes me feel just a little bit more awake. I dry my face with the towel hanging next to the sink and stare at my reflection in the mirror.

“My eyes are all puffy from lack of sleep… I don’t want Otsuki-kun to see me like this…”

I mumble absentmindedly, my brain still half-asleep, and only realize what I said a moment later, causing my face to flush. Embarrassed, I quickly turn away from the mirror and head downstairs to the living room.

“Oh? Good morning, Ayaka. You’re up early today.”

“Good morning, Mom.”

Mom’s already in the kitchen, preparing breakfast.

“I’ve got plans to meet up with Saki today, so I need to leave by ten.”

“With Saki-chan? Oh, come to think of it, I haven’t seen her in ages.”

“Yeah, ever since she moved, it’s been harder for her to visit.”

Before she moved away, Saki used to come over all the time, so of course, she and Mom are well-acquainted.

“Say hi to Saki-chan for me, okay?”

“Sure, I will.”

Nodding to Mom, I take a seat at the dining table.

“Are you heading to work already, Mom?”

Mom’s already dressed in her work attire, looking all set. Dad, on the other hand, seems to have left for work even earlier.

“Yep, I’ve got an early shift today. Before you meet Saki-chan, could you take Ryota to kindergarten?”

“Yeah, I can do that.”

Even though it’s summer vacation, if both parents are busy with work in the morning, we use the daycare service at Ryota’s kindergarten when there’s an opening.

“Would you like breakfast now?”

“Hmm, yeah, I guess I’ll eat.”

“Alright, I’ll bring it out in a bit, so just wait.”

About ten minutes later, Mom sets the breakfast on the table, and I’m a bit taken aback by the sight.

“Whoa, today’s breakfast looks fancy. It’s like something from a traditional inn.”

“Doesn’t it? Otsuki-kun made all of this in advance for us yesterday. It’s been such a big help since I had to leave for work early today.”

Mom’s in high spirits as she explains, while I just sit there, stunned. When did Otsuki-kun prepare all of this? I didn’t notice at all.

As I stare blankly at the impressive spread, Mom starts describing each dish.

“This is tai-meshi (sea bream rice). Then over here, we have grilled Spanish mackerel with miso, braised yellowtail, spinach and carrot shira-ae (tofu salad), and finally, sea bream clear soup.”

“That’s... amazing...”

What’s with this breakfast? Are we at an inn? My sleepiness instantly vanishes.

I can’t hide my surprise as I say “Let's dig in” and pick up my chopsticks.

“...It’s delicious.”

The tai-meshi is infused with a rich broth, with the aroma of soy sauce and ginger wafting through, while the sweetness of the sea bream’s meat gently spreads on my tongue. The grilled Spanish mackerel is tender, with a slightly sweet and salty flavor that blends perfectly with its savory fat. It’s so good that I can’t stop smiling. I can’t stop my chopsticks from reaching for more.

“Hehe, Ayaka, you look like you’re in heaven,” Mom teases with a grin.

“Because it’s just so good,” I say with a smile.

“That’s right. We owe it to Otsuki-kun,” Mom replies.

Hearing her words, I instinctively tense up. But unlike yesterday, she doesn’t tease me this time. Instead, she’s looking at me with this incredibly gentle gaze. It makes me feel a bit... embarrassed somehow.

“Ayaka,” she says softly.

“...What?” I reply, trying to act nonchalant.

“You know, youth is just a fleeting moment in life. It passes by so quickly, but it’s also the most fun, the most painful, the time when you’ll have the most doubts and joys... It’s such an incredibly precious period. So, live in the present as much as you can. Everything you’re feeling now will someday become a valuable treasure for you.”

“...Yeah.”

Mom is so unfair. Normally, she’s always grinning and teasing me, but once in a while, she becomes a real ‘mother’ like this. And when she does that, it makes me, as her ‘daughter,’ feel genuinely happy.

“This clear soup is really delicious,” I say, trying to change the subject.

“Isn’t it? It’s absolutely wonderful,” she agrees.

Together, Mom and I savor the comforting dishes Otsuki-kun made, enjoying their gentle flavors.

※

After taking Ryota to kindergarten, I head to the café where I’m meeting Saki.

The café, quietly nestled in a peaceful residential area off the main street, exudes a calm atmosphere. As I open the door, the pleasant chime of a bell rings.

“Welcome,” the master, who was wiping a glass at the counter, brings me a glass of water after I take my seat.

“Have you decided on your order?” he asks.

“Yes, I’ll have an iced café au lait, please.”

“Certainly,” he replies with a polite bow before returning to the counter.

The store’s calm ambiance, paired with the gentlemanly master, gives off a quiet charm. Since it’s off the main street, there are only a few customers, with only two others besides me.

Hmm, Saki’s not here yet.

Surrounded by the soft jazz music in the background, I’d like to relax and enjoy waiting for Saki in my favorite café, but today I just can’t settle down. I keep glancing at the clock on the wall, feeling restless as I wait for my best friend. My mind is filled with the things Saki told me last night. I need to hear more from her.

...Ugh! Time isn’t moving at all!

When I checked the clock earlier, it was 10:40, but when I look again, it’s still 10:41? Is the clock broken?

I check my phone for the time.

10:41... oh, now it’s 10:42. Ugh, a single minute feels like forever. I really want Saki to hurry up.

After what feels like the longest few minutes of my life, I finally see my best friend appear at the entrance of the café.

“Ah, hey, Ayaka. Did I make you wait long?”

“I’ve been waiting forever! Over ten minutes!”

“Okay, okay, that’s within the acceptable range.”

Saki brushes off my complaints and sits down across from me. The time is now 10:50. She’s arrived a good ten minutes before our scheduled meet-up, so I can’t really complain any further.

Unable to wait any longer, I ask Saki, “Hey, about what you said yesterday, I—”

“Hold on! Wait up, my dear little lost lamb. Let me order first.”

“Oh, right, sorry.”

“So, what did you order, Ayaka?”

“Iced café au lait.”

“Alright, I’ll have the same.”

Saki places her order with the master, who had come over to take it, and then takes a sip of the water that’s been served to her.

Ugh! I can’t stand it, I want to hear the story already! Is she doing this on purpose, teasing me?

After drinking the water, Saki says, “Ah, this really hits the spot,” and when our eyes meet, she covers her mouth, holding back a smile.

“Seriously, Ayaka, what kind of face is that?”

“Because… you’re making me wait,” I pout, my cheeks puffing up and lips sticking out.

“Well, you’re cute, aren’t you? Alright then! I’ll help you out, let’s talk!” Saki says, grinning.

“What did you mean by ‘those feelings’ you talked about yesterday? What is it that I don’t understand?”

I immediately ask the question that’s been running through my mind since last night. Saki, however, laughs in amusement.

I’m being serious here, and she’s laughing... ugh...

“Haha, that was sudden! You haven’t been sleeping well, have you?” she teases.

“Of course not! After the way our call ended, I couldn’t help but wonder!”

“Sorry, but I wanted to talk about the important stuff in person.”

“Well… I guess that’s true...” I reluctantly agree with Saki.

“Okay, well, let’s get to the main topic.”

Saki’s expression tightens slightly, and she looks at me seriously before speaking.

What should I do? I’ve wanted to ask this for so long, but now that it’s finally happening, I kind of want to cover my ears... or even run away...

“Just to confirm, Otsuki-kun started visiting your house as a housekeeper, right?”

“Yeah.”

“And, Ryota, Ikue, and Shuichi all like him, right?”

“Yeah.”

“And now, you’ve started to get interested in Otsuki-kun recently, right?”

“Ugh... yeah...”

When I put it into words again, it feels so embarrassing. My face is probably red right now.

"So, Ayaka, you're interested in Otsuki-kun, but you want to know if it's love or something else, right?"

"Love... well, yeah..."  

Love... I see. If I’ve started liking Otsuki-kun, then that means... I must be in love with him, right What should I do? My heartbeat is getting faster, and my chest feels a little tight... While watching my reaction, Saki speaks slowly.  

"So, Ayaka, how do you feel about your own emotions?"  

"I don't really know, so I came to talk to you about it..."  

"I see. Well, then..."  

Saki looks up as if thinking for a moment, then turns to me with a mischievous smile.  

"Hey, why don’t you introduce me to Otsuki-kun?"  

The moment I hear her words, my heart races with shock.  

"Eh!? W-why?"  

What? No way... why? Does Saki also like Otsuki-kun?  

"J-just kidding, right? You’re joking, right, Saki?"  

"Nope, no joke. So, when Otsuki-kun comes over to your house next time, I can come too, right?"  

"...No."  

I blurted out the words before I even had a chance to think.  

Imagining Saki talking with Otsuki-kun, my chest tightens with a kind of pain I’ve never felt before. This feeling... I've never experienced it before. But the Otsuki-kun I know is the one who comes to do housekeeping, the one only I know. I don’t want anyone, even my best friend Saki, to know that side of him.  

"Is it really no good?"  

Saki asks, pressing on.  

"Yeah... no... it's really no good."  

Saki’s so cute. Unlike me, she knows how to talk to boys and is really good at it. If she and Otsuki-kun get along well, I’m sure he’ll be drawn to her.  And then... then Otsuki-kun will...  

"He'll be taken away."  

"Eh!?"  

I open my eyes wide at Saki’s words.  

"You thought just now, right? That Otsuki-kun would be taken away by me?"  

"Ugh... no, not really... well, yeah... maybe I thought that..."  

Saki smiles smugly at my response.  

"That made you feel bad, didn’t it?"  

"Ugh... yeah, it did..."  

"Why do you think that is?"  

Saki asks, almost like a teacher quizzing a student.  

Why? Why did I feel so bad? Was it because I didn’t want Saki to get closer to Otsuki-kun? Or was it that I didn’t want anyone else to know the Otsuki-kun I know? In other words, do I want to... keep Otsuki-kun all to myself? But why? Why do I want to keep him to myself?  

The reason... the reason must be... because I...  

"Like him..."  

I said it... I finally said it. My feelings for Otsuki-kun.  

After hearing my answer, Saki smiles gently at me.  

"Well done. You get a gold star."  

"...Do I like Otsuki-kun? Is this really what liking someone feels like?"  

"Well, yeah."  

I place my hand on my chest. The slightly faster heartbeat makes me look down.  

"You don’t seem convinced, Ayaka. What’s bothering you?"  

"I... don’t know what it is I like about Otsuki-kun. When did I start liking him? I just... don’t know."  

The first time I really interacted with Otsuki-kun was just a few days ago, when the summer vacation started. He’s only been to my house to do housekeeping four times. Why have I started liking him in such a short time?  

"I don’t even know when I fell for him. Isn’t it supposed to be clear when you fall in love? Isn’t that how it works in normal love stories?"  

I only started being aware of Otsuki-kun after he caught me when I almost fell off the unicycle, but now that I think about it, I think I might have started to notice him even before that...  

"Ayaka, what’s your idea of 'normal' when you say normal?"  

"Huh? Well, obviously, it’s based on romance mangas and novels, right?"

The moment I said that, Saki let out a dramatic sigh and looked up at the sky.  

"Listen, Ayaka, okay? Your standard is not normal. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of normal."  

"Huh? That’s not true! In every romance manga I’ve read, the moment the heroine falls in love is crystal clear, right? Some even use a full-page spread to show it!"  

"Stop using manga standards to talk about real love! That’s so embarrassing!"  
Saki stopped me with a flustered tone and gave me a look like she was pitying someone.  

"Do you get it? Manga has readers, right? And the goal is to entertain them, so they make things really obvious. Understand?"  

"But, but! It’s not just manga, romance novels too—"  

"That’s fiction!! All fantasy! If anything, it’s the author’s imagination! It’s impossible in real life!"  

"Eh!? No way..."  
Saki’s words shattered my idea of love.  

So, does that mean the 'love' I’ve been dreaming of until now was all just an illusion?  

I was deeply shocked, and Saki sighed dramatically.  

"Manga and novels are based on real-life experiences, so I’m not totally denying them. But, in my opinion, real love is something completely different."  

"…Is that so? So, does that mean in real life, you can’t really tell when you fall in love?"  

"Well, sometimes you can tell, but most of the time, you just realize you’ve already fallen in love without knowing when it happened."  

"Realizing you’ve fallen in love without knowing when..."  

That’s exactly what’s happening to me right now.  

"Bu-but, in real life, if you lock eyes with the person you like, you still get that little flutter in your chest, right?"  

"Yeah, that’s true."  

"Then maybe I haven’t fallen in love yet... maybe it’s still just a crush."  

Back when I nearly fell off the unicycle, I tried to make eye contact with Otsuki-kun to test my feelings. When our eyes met while shopping at the supermarket, I did feel a bit... just a little... but I was more surprised by the sudden eye contact than anything. And when we stood side by side in the kitchen afterward, I didn’t feel that flutter... I don’t think I did.  

When I told Saki this, she sighed heavily again.  

"Like I said, you can’t use fiction as a standard, okay? And you said you didn’t feel that much of a flutter when you locked eyes with Otsuki-kun, but..."  

After a brief pause, Saki hit me with a shocking truth.  

"You were already feeling fluttery before you even made eye contact with him."  

"──Huh!?"  

I opened my eyes wide in disbelief. Now that she said it... she might be right...  

I froze, mouth agape, as Saki gave me a wry smile.  

"If you were already feeling all fluttery for Otsuki-kun, and then you locked eyes, of course your heart would almost stop. You’d be a goner from love’s attack—heading straight to the afterlife."  

"Love’s attack... straight to the afterlife..."  

So, I might’ve been in serious danger at that moment.  

"So... so does that mean I was already in love with Otsuki-kun back then?"  

I couldn’t hide my panic, and I asked Saki, my voice trembling.  

"That’s what it sounds like."  

Saki answered like it was the most obvious thing. I took a moment to calm myself, sipping some water.  

"But... I don’t know much about Otsuki-kun, so why did I end up liking him?"  

We never really interacted at school, and then, out of nowhere, I started liking him after he came to do housekeeping. Is that really possible?  

"Maybe it’s because you didn’t know him, and you wanted to know more."  

"Huh? What do you mean?"  

"Because you didn’t know him, you wanted to learn more about him. Then you learned a new side of him and liked him even more. You wanted to know even more. That’s how love works, right?"  

Learning about his unknown side and liking him even more...  

Saki’s words reminded me of something that happened yesterday. When I accidentally ran into Otsuki-kun at the supermarket, I was struck by how charming his innocent smile was. I felt so drawn to him in a way I hadn’t before.  

"Love is really like that, huh..."  

"Oh? You already have a clue about it, huh?"  

"U-yeah..."  

"Fufu~ Sounds like you're having some great youthful moments."  

Saki teased me with a smirk, and I couldn’t hold back a shy glance away from her.

"Sorry for the wait. Here’s your iced café au lait."

Just then, the master brought over my order. I quickly grabbed the straw and took a sip of the iced café au lait. The slightly bitter, cold beverage seemed to cool my overheated body, making me feel more at ease.

With my mind a little calmer, I decided to process my conversation with Saki.

First, I’ve realized that I like Otsuki-kun... There’s no denying it anymore. It’s a fact I can’t turn away from. I need to face these feelings properly. But, there’s a small part of me that’s a little dissatisfied.

It’s the reason I started liking Otsuki-kun. Saki told me not to rely on manga or novels, but I can’t help it — I can’t easily abandon my ideals. She says it’s not about the unicycle incident, but when I think back on it, it seems like I started liking him even before that.

In my ideal romance, there’s always a moment when a guy offers an umbrella on a rainy day, or swoops in to help me when a delinquent starts causing trouble. Or maybe the guy turns out to be my childhood friend, who I’ve secretly liked for a long time. I mean, I don’t have a childhood friend who’s a boy, but still... those situations are every girl’s dream. Because... I’m a girl.

"Saki, you’ve had a boyfriend before, right?"

"Yeah."

"What was the trigger? How did it happen?"

"Well, the trigger... Hmm, I guess...?"

"Guess?"

I stared at Saki, waiting for an answer.

"Maybe it was just... kind of spontaneous?"

"Spontaneous...?"

Her answer wasn’t quite what I expected, and I felt a bit disappointed. Saki gave me a wry smile.

"That’s how reality works, you know? You think someone’s kind of nice, then you start noticing them more, and before you know it, you’re thinking about them all the time, and eventually, you like them. It’s something like that. No specific trigger."

"Is that so..."

But that’s true, right? Reality isn’t like the manga or novels. Not everyone experiences dramatic, romantic love.

As I tried to convince myself, Saki looked at me with a bit of disbelief.

"Listen, you’re fixated on the trigger for liking Otsuki-kun, but don’t you already have one?"

"Huh?"

I was surprised. Did I have a trigger for falling for Otsuki-kun?

"Huh? What? You’re kind of spacey sometimes, aren’t you? But that’s what makes you cute and hard to ignore."

"Sp-spacey? That’s too harsh!"

I didn’t want to be seen as spacey! Sure, my mom and other friends sometimes call me "airheaded," but I’m not... spacey!

"You’re spacey. I mean, you already had an amazing trigger for falling for Otsuki-kun, but you forgot about it."

"Amazing trigger? No way."

"Oh, come on. You hired a housekeeping service, and guess what? A hidden high-spec guy from your class showed up. It’s like a miracle trigger."

A shock ran through me.

"Wait, if you just look at it, this could be the title of a rom-com."

That’s right! A title like that would fit perfectly on the bookshelf in my room, and it wouldn’t feel out of place at all.

"Finally realized it, huh? Or do you need an even stronger trigger?"

"N-no... this is more than enough."

I couldn’t make excuses anymore.

I was completely in love with Otsuki-kun.

"I... I’ve fallen for him, haven’t I?"

"You’ve finally come to terms with it."

"I just... don’t have any excuses left."

Maybe, from the very beginning, I was already interested in Otsuki-kun. Maybe it was love at first sight.

I had rejected confessions from guys in the past because I never understood love at first sight.

And now, I was feeling what I had once dismissed.

"Saki, what should I do now?"

This was my first love.

I had no idea what to do.

"Should... should I confess?"

Just imagining it made my heart race, and I felt like I might pass out from nervousness. I was afraid I’d literally die from the intensity of this crush.

Had the boys who confessed to me before felt this nervous, I wonder? If so, I might have been a little too quick to reject them without really thinking. I felt a little guilty about it.

While I was thinking about confessing to Otsuki-kun, Saki interrupted me.

"Don’t rush, Ayaka. You’re not ready to confess yet."

"Huh? Not ready...?"

Once I realized my feelings for Otsuki-kun, I thought confessing was the next step. But Saki gave me some advice with a bit of a warning.

"Confession is just the end goal for now. You need to take steps before you get there."

"Steps? What kind?"

"First, you need to get closer to him. Ask him out on a date."

A date... with Otsuki-kun...

What would that look like? Would we go to an amusement park, shopping, or the beach? Would I have to wear a swimsuit in front of him? That’s so embarrassing just thinking about it! But... I kind of want to see him in a swimsuit too...

"Hey, Ayaka, your silly smile is showing."

"H-Huh... I-I wasn’t...!"

"What, what? Were you thinking something naughty?"

"Wh-what!? No, of course not!!"

I immediately denied it, flustered. I wasn’t thinking anything bad! I just thought about going to the beach with Otsuki-kun... it’s not my fault that swimming suits are part of the package...

"Hmm, I see..."

"N-no! I wasn’t thinking anything weird!"

Saki eyed me suspiciously. I had to change the subject quickly.

"R-right, actually, I had promised to go to the zoo with Otsuki-kun."

At that, Saki froze for a moment and looked at me in shock.

"Wait, what!? You’ve already managed to plan a date with him?"

"Well... not exactly a date, more like I’m going to be tagging along with Ryota... something like that."

"I see, Ryota’s coming with you..."

Saki seemed to be thinking deeply, hand on her chin.

"That lowers the bar, but it’s possible Otsuki-kun might not see it as a date. Have you decided when you’re going to the zoo?"

"No, not yet. We’re still figuring out the schedule."

"Got it... well, you can use that discussion about the schedule as an excuse..."

Saki started thinking again, her eyes narrowing as she worked through ideas. Unlike me, Saki had been in relationships before. It was probably best to stay quiet and let her take the lead.

After a few moments, Saki suddenly pulled something from her bag and handed it to me.

"I’ll give you a little secret weapon for your love life, Ayaka."

"A secret weapon?"

She handed me two tickets that looked like movie vouchers. "Use these to invite Otsuki-kun to a movie."

"Huh? A movie date... just like that?"

"It’s not out of nowhere. You already have the zoo promise, right?"

"Y-yeah..."

"Then, you can bring it up when you talk about the schedule. You can say, 'While we’re at it, let’s watch a movie together,' and invite him."

"Uh, okay..."

Wasn’t that a bit too high of a hurdle? Could I really invite him like that?

Seeing my hesitation, Saki gave me a serious look.

"Ayaka, you’re still at the starting line of love, okay? Actually, you might not even be there yet."

"Huh? R-really?"

"Yes. Love is a competition, you know? A very, very tough competition. Sometimes, you might even regret getting involved."

"That sounds... scary."

"Yeah. But once you fall in love, you can’t control it. Before you know it, you’re watching that person with your eyes, and a simple exchange in the morning makes your whole day shine. On days you can’t see them, you just think about them all day. You can’t stop it, it just happens."

Saki’s words echoed in my mind.

I wonder if that’s how it feels for me? I like Otsuki-kun, but... maybe it’s not that deep yet? Or maybe, someday, it will be? Saki said I’m not even at the starting line yet... Love sounds so scary... but also, just a little... no, a lot... exciting.

"I'll invite him to a movie," I said, looking at the discount tickets Saki had given me.

"Yeah, good luck," she responded with a short but encouraging word and a big smile.  

"Hey, you'll still listen to me if I need advice, right?"  

"Of course! Honestly, I’m so happy I can talk about this kind of stuff with you, Ayaka."  

Her reassuring words made me smile too.  

"You know, Ayaka, you’ve been avoiding boys for a while, but now, someone you like, someone you think is special, has come along. I’m really glad for you, from the bottom of my heart."  

"...Yeah. Thank you."  

Saki really is irreplaceable. I’m so lucky to have a friend like her.  

"I’ll do my best!"  

"Yeah, yeah, go for it! I’m cheering for you with all my might!"  

I declared with determination, and Saki responded with a big smile.  

"So, so... what do you like about Otsuki-kun?"  
"Th-that's..."  

After that, I spent time talking about my first ever love with my best friend, not even noticing how quickly the time passed.

※

On my way back from the café, I looked up at the sky while walking down the road leading home. The summer sky stretched endlessly, cloudless and blue, and I found myself reflecting on my feelings, as if they were blending into the vastness of the sky.  

I... have fallen in love!  

Since I became aware of it, it felt like the world had changed.  Everything I saw seemed to shine, and my life up until now felt faded in comparison. My heart was filled with such vivid colors, I could hardly recognize it. The excitement in my chest, the rising emotions—it all felt like it was expanding, just like the endless summer sky above me.  

I looked at the two discount tickets I had been holding so carefully.  Saki's love secret tools. First, with these, I'll invite Otsuki-kun on a date!  

Summer vacation had only just begun.  With a feeling of exhilaration I had never experienced before, and just as much anxiety, I walked forward, my steps light with anticipation.  

"Love is amazing!"
