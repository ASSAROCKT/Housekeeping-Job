After successfully completing the housework for the Tojo family, Haruto found himself visiting his best friend, Akagi Tomoya, the next day.

“Hey, Haru. Weren’t you planning on just studying and working part-time during summer break? Are you sure you should be wasting time hanging out at my place?” Tomoya teased.

“Well, that was the plan,” Haruto replied, continuing as he sorted through the messy bookshelf full of manga, “but last night I happened to watch a TV special about hoarder houses.”

“I suddenly got worried, you know? What if the next house featured is my best friend’s room?”

“My room isn’t that filthy!!” Tomoya shot back, lifting himself off the back of his chair in protest.

It was the peak of midsummer, with scorching hot days one after another. Bright sunlight streamed into Tomoya’s room, yet thanks to the air conditioning, only the sun’s brightness was welcomed while the room temperature remained comfortably cool.

“To be honest, my own AC is acting up, so I'm just seeking some refuge here.” Haruto said casually, prompting Tomoya to shoot him a glare.

“Hey, I’m going to charge you for the electricity.”

“Then I’ll charge you for cleaning up your room. And I’ll bill you for all the past times too.”

“I’m so sorry. Please, feel free to make yourself at home,” Tomoya conceded, quickly surrendering.

Leaning back into his chair, he turned to Haruto again. “By the way, yesterday was your first day at the new part-time job, right? How was it, doing housework for other people?”

“Hmm... let’s see...” Haruto paused his cleaning to think for a moment. “Well, it was rewarding, I’d say.”

Recalling the grateful smile of Ayaka Tojo saying “thank you,” Haruto answered with a content expression.

“Hmm? What’s with that grin, Haru?” Tomoya teased.

Startled, Haruto quickly adjusted his expression. “Huh? I wasn’t grinning or anything.”

“No, you definitely were... oh, I get it!”

“W-What do you mean?”

“The client for that housework job must’ve been a beautiful older woman, right?” Tomoya said with a knowing smirk.

Haruto’s eyebrows twitched slightly at his best friend’s confident assertion. “No, that’s not it!”

“Oh, yes it is. And that lady is probably a worn-out office worker, right?”

“Stop with your weird fantasies.”

“And that lady’s super sexy, right? You’re the masochist type, Haru, so I bet you’d try to hide that sort of thing,” Tomoya said, crossing his arms with a satisfied nod.

Haruto, exasperated, sighed. “Like that’s ever gonna happen. And who are you calling masochist, anyway?”

“Is that really not it? But the client was a beautiful woman, wasn’t she?”

“Why are you so sure about that?”

“Eh? I just had a feeling,” Tomoya said as if it were the most obvious thing. Haruto, unsure whether his friend was just lucky or truly sharp, gave him a slightly strained smile.

“Hey, Haru, seriously—did anything... spicy happen?” Tomoya asked with a grin.

“No way! There’s no way anything like that would happen with Tojo-san.”

“...Huh? Tojo-san?”

“...Ah...” Haruto realized he had let it slip and hurriedly clammed up.

“Wait! Tojo-san as in that Tojo-san? Tojo **Ayaka**!?”

“N-No, it’s not—”

“Yes, it is! That reaction totally confirms it’s Ayaka Tojo!” Tomoya exclaimed, practically jumping out of his seat, convinced now that Haruto’s client had been Tojo.

Knowing it was impossible to cover it up any longer, Haruto decided to come clean while also making sure to secure Tomoya’s silence.

“Listen, you absolutely cannot tell anyone that Tojo-san hired me for housework, okay? I could get in serious trouble with my company if I don’t protect clients' privacy. I trust you, Tomoya. If you blab, we’re done.”

“Yeah, yeah, I won’t tell anyone. But seriously... so, how was it?”

“How was what?” Haruto tilted his head, resuming his cleaning of Tomoya’s messy room.

“What do you think I mean? You got invited, didn’t you? To Tojo-san’s house!”

“Invited? Seriously?” Haruto looked at Tomoya, exasperated.

“I didn’t go to Tojo-san’s house to hang out; I went there for work.”

“Yeah, right. So, what’s her place like? I bet it smelled really nice, huh?” Tomoya asked eagerly, completely ignoring Haruto’s words.

Haruto let out a deep sigh. “Dude, you sound like a creep. And by the way, that question falls under client privacy, so I can’t answer it.”

“Geez, you’re so stingy! Aren’t I your best friend?” Tomoya pouted dramatically, sticking out his lips.

If a cute girl had made that face, maybe Haruto’s heart would have softened a bit, but unfortunately, when a guy did it, no matter how much he pouted, it only annoyed him more.

“Stingy~ Stingy Haru~ Stingy, stingy, stingyyyy~”

“Shut up!” Haruto shouted, throwing a music magazine he had in his hands. Tomoya dodged it easily and burst into laughter.

“But seriously, Haru, isn’t this great?”

“Huh? What’s great?”

“You might actually get closer to Tojo-san this summer! I’m so jealous~” Tomoya said, grinning as he sat cross-legged on his chair.

But Haruto, not quite grasping what his friend meant, frowned. “How would one visit to her house make us closer?”

“Huh? Won’t you be going to Tojo-san’s house multiple times while you continue the part-time job?” Tomoya asked, looking genuinely confused.

Haruto shook his head. “Nope, that was a one-time thing. I won’t be going to her place again.”

“Eh? Why not?”

“Think about it—how weird would it be to have a classmate come over to clean your house? If I were Tojo-san, I’d definitely request someone else next time. It’s just way too awkward to have a classmate do housework for you.”

“Hmm? Really?” Tomoya said, tilting his head as he looked at Haruto, who was currently cleaning his room.

“I don’t think it’s awkward at all, though?”

“......”

At Tomoya’s nonchalant response, Haruto couldn’t help but twitch his lips.

“Maybe I really should charge you,” Haruto muttered under his breath.

“Wha—!? N-No, please spare me! I’m broke after buying this!” Tomoya pleaded desperately, clutching a black case that was lying nearby.

“Oh? You got a new one?” Haruto noticed that the black case Tomoya was holding was a guitar case.

Tomoya had been playing the guitar since elementary school and was now in a band with students from other schools.

“Yeah, totally. When I went to the music shop recently, I fell in love with this one at first sight,” Tomoya said, rubbing his cheek against the guitar with a satisfied grin. Haruto, slightly creeped out by his friend’s antics, glanced over at the other guitar propped up against the wall.

“Do you really need two guitars?”

“Yes, absolutely! You can never have too many guitars!” Tomoya declared with passion.

“Hmm, is that so?” Haruto, who was clueless about instruments or music, gave a half-hearted reply and went back to tidying up the room.

“Hey! Show some interest, will ya?”

“Sorry, I just don’t really get music. Plus, I have no plans to play an instrument.”

“Aw, come on! Why don’t you start playing the guitar and form a band with me?” Tomoya said, wiggling his hands as if to entice Haruto. “I’ll give you a hands-on lesson, you know.”

“Nah, I’ll pass.”

“Then be our vocalist! Our band’s planning to perform at the school festival this year. Come on, let’s enjoy our youth together!” Tomoya exclaimed with a thumbs-up and a bright smile.

Without stopping his cleaning, Haruto replied indifferently, “No thanks.”

“Don’t be like that! Join our band!” Tomoya pleaded, whining like a child throwing a tantrum, but Haruto ignored him and continued with his work.

“Haruuu~ Let’s form a band and have fun with music~!”

“Yeah, yeah, I’ll think about it. By the way, isn’t Haruka-chan around today?” Haruto replied dismissively, trying to change the subject as he asked about Tomoya’s little sister.

“She’s at summer classes since this morning,” Tomoya said.

“Ah, right. Haruka’s got entrance exams next year,” Haruto nodded.

Tomoya, who was Haruto’s best friend and childhood friend, had a sister two years younger than them. To Haruto, Haruka was like a little sister as well. The three of them often played together when they were younger, and Haruka would affectionately call him “Haru-nii.”

“Yeah, she’s all fired up to attend the same high school as you next year.”

“I see... so Haruka-chan’s gonna be my junior next year, huh?”

“That’s if she passes her exams.”

“Haruka-chan will be fine,” Haruto said confidently. She was resourceful, and he was sure she’d be attending their high school next year.

As he imagined that future, Haruto couldn’t help but smile. Seeing this, Tomoya shot him a mischievous grin.

“Hey, Haru, are you gonna cheat on Tojo-san with Haruka?”

“Huh? What the hell are you talking about? And like I said earlier, I’m not going to be invited to Tojo-san’s place again.”

“Oh, really?”

Despite Haruto’s firm statement, Tomoya continued to grin, throwing a suspicious look as if he found the whole situation amusing.

※

"I'll never be called here again... There was a time I really believed that," Haruto muttered to himself, standing in front of a grand mansion.

Yesterday, he'd confidently told Tomoya that he'd never have to visit the Tojo household again. He genuinely thought he wouldn't return there for any more housework assignments. But now, as he found himself in front of the Tojo residence once more, anxiety began to creep in.

"Could it be... they called me back because of a complaint? Like, maybe the hamburgers were spoiled and gave them food poisoning? No, no, if that happened, they’d usually complain directly to the company..."

Various scenarios swirled through Haruto’s mind, all of them unlikely, yet his negative thoughts weighed heavily on him. With an unsteady finger, he pressed the intercom button. The chime sounded, and the brief moment that followed felt like an eternity.

"Hello there~! Who’s this?" The voice that came through was bright and cheerful, a stark contrast to Haruto’s tension.

"Uh, I’m from the housekeeping service," Haruto replied.

"Oh! We've been expecting you! I’ll open the door right away, so please wait just a moment!"

The voice sounded somewhat like Ayaka Tojo’s, but it was far more cheerful than he remembered, almost mismatched with her usual demeanor. Haruto wondered if it might be Ayaka’s older sister.

In Haruto’s mind, Ayaka Tojo was the type who was more reserved and graceful. The last time he visited, she came across as quiet and diligent, always taking good care of her younger brother. She gave off a mature, responsible vibe.

As he pondered, the front door finally opened with a click, revealing a woman. She looked to be in her late twenties, with strikingly beautiful features. Given her resemblance to Ayaka, Haruto assumed she was indeed her sister.

"So, you’re Ootsuki-kun, right? Come on in, come on in!"

"Ah, yes. Thank you for having me," Haruto said, stepping into the house and slipping into the guest slippers he brought. As he did, he noticed Ryota peeking out from down the hallway.

"Hey, Ryota-kun, good afternoon."

"...Good afternoon."

"Did you like the hamburgers?"

Though he still seemed a bit wary, Ryota’s expression softened at Haruto’s question.

"Yeah, they were really good."

"I’m glad to hear that," Haruto replied with a warm smile, making Ryota blush shyly.

"Fufufu, Ayaka told me that Ryota was completely absorbed in eating those hamburgers," the woman, whom Haruto still assumed was Ayaka’s older sister, remarked with a smile.

"Mom, you ate the hamburgers too! Didn’t you think they were delicious?" Ryota enthusiastically asked, as if trying to hide his embarrassment.

"Yes, they were absolutely delicious."

The word "mom" struck Haruto like a bolt of lightning. He was frozen in shock. The woman he had thought was Ayaka’s older sister was actually her mother. She looked so youthful and vibrant that it was hard to believe she had two children.

Unaware of Haruto’s inner turmoil, Ryota eagerly asked, "So, what are you making today?"

"Hey now, Ryota. Let’s first show Ootsuki-kun to the living room," his mother gently chided.

"Oh, right." Ryota nodded obediently, then turned to Haruto with a bright smile. "This way!"

Haruto followed him, smiling as he entered the living room.

"Ryota’s been asking since this morning, ‘Is the big brother who made the delicious hamburgers coming today?’ He just wouldn’t stop," his mother said with a lighthearted laugh.

"Is that so?" Haruto replied, still trying to maintain a pleasant smile despite his inner shock at realizing she was Ayaka’s mother.

"Well, let me officially introduce myself. Thank you for using our housekeeping service. My name is Ootsuki, and I’ll be your assigned staff member. Today, the plan is for a three-hour session including cleaning and dinner preparation. Is that correct?"

"Yes, that’s right." Ayaka’s mother nodded but then made a slightly dissatisfied expression.

"Ayaka told me that you’re actually her classmate, Ootsuki-kun?" Ikue Tojo, Ayaka’s mother, asked with a curious smile.

"Uh, yes, that’s correct," Haruto replied.

"Then there’s no need to be so formal with me! And please, don’t call me Tojo-sama. Just call me Ikue!"

Haruto was taken aback by her casual request.

"But even if you're my classmate's mother, you're still a client to me, so..."

"Don’t say such a distasteful thing! Just be more relaxed, alright?"

"Uh... well..."

"Pretty please?" she added, tilting her head slightly while clasping her hands together, looking up at him with pleading eyes.

Ikue Tojo was, without a doubt, a beautiful woman. She had the youthful charm of her high school daughter, Ayaka, but with the added elegance of a mature woman. Being directly asked by someone so attractive made Haruto, who was still very much in his teenage years, feel flustered.

"Alright... I-I’ll call you Ikue-san," he reluctantly agreed.

"Wonderful! Thank you, Ootsuki-kun!"

"Uh, you're welcome," Haruto replied, his cheeks lightly flushed as he bowed slightly. Just then, Ayaka entered the living room.

"Oh, Ootsuki-kun. You’re here. Welcome."

"Excuse me for intruding, To— uh, Tojo-san," Haruto corrected himself mid-sentence, sensing Ikue’s watchful gaze.

"Thank you for using our service again."

"Yeah, well, after the last time, I told my parents about the house cleaning and the delicious hamburgers you made. When they found out that the person behind it was actually my classmate Ootsuki-kun, both of them wanted to meet you. And Ryota kept pestering me about wanting to eat your cooking again," Ayaka explained, her cheeks slightly reddening.

Haruto bowed politely. "I'm so glad to hear you were satisfied with my previous service. I'll do my best again today to meet your expectations."

"Y-yeah, please do," Ayaka replied, bowing slightly in return. Watching the exchange, Ikue couldn’t help but chuckle softly.

"Oh my, you two are classmates, aren’t you? Why don’t you try being a bit more friendly with each other?"

Ayaka looked slightly troubled by her mother’s comment. "But... I’ve never really talked to Ootsuki-kun at school before..."

"Well, then this is the perfect opportunity to get to know each other better, right, Ootsuki-kun?"

"Huh? Oh, um, yes... I suppose so," Haruto answered, feeling a bit caught off guard. But given the current flow of the conversation, he figured disagreeing would only make things more awkward, so he nodded in agreement.

Satisfied with his response, Ikue smiled at her daughter. "Ayaka, you don’t have any male friends, do you? Ootsuki-kun seems like a nice boy, so this is a good chance."

"Hey, Mom! That’s not the reason I called him here..." Ayaka protested, her face turning even redder.

"Oh? So you don’t want to be friends with Ootsuki-kun?"

"It’s not that I don’t want to... I just..."

"See? That means you do want to be friends! Sorry about that, Ootsuki-kun. This girl has always been bad at expressing herself in these situations," Ikue said with a teasing smile.

"Mom, stop it... Ugh..." Ayaka groaned in embarrassment, her face burning red. Haruto, unsure of how to handle the situation, just laughed awkwardly before quickly trying to change the topic.

"Um, well then, let’s get started with the cleaning. Is there anything specific you’d like me to focus on?"

"Hmm... let’s see," Ikue said, contemplating for a moment before glancing toward the window. "Actually, the windows have been bothering me lately. Do you think you could clean those as well?"

"Of course, I’d be happy to."

Haruto gave a polite bow and walked over to inspect the windows more closely. "You’re right, there’s definitely some noticeable dirt here."

"Right? It got like this after that recent dust storm and rain."

"Got it. I’ll start with the window cleaning right away," Haruto said, rolling up his sleeves to get to work.

"Oh my, Ootsuki-kun, you’ve got quite the muscular arms, don’t you?" Ikue remarked, her eyes widening with interest.

"Ah, well, I’ve been practicing karate since I was a kid," he explained.

"Oh my! So you were a karate kid! That’s amazing!" she exclaimed, clearly impressed.

Ikue clapped her hands in praise, making Haruto bow his head slightly, embarrassed. "Thank you very much," he said. Feeling a bit pleased from the compliment, Haruto began unpacking the items he brought for window cleaning.

While he used the larger equipment, like vacuums, provided by the clients' homes, he often relied on his own supplies for smaller tasks, such as rags. Though some of these were company-issued, others were things he brought from home. When he had mentioned to his grandmother that he was taking on a part-time job in home cleaning, she had given him a variety of useful items.

To clean the windows, Haruto moistened a piece of newspaper. Just then, Ryota approached him with a curious look.

"What are you doing with that newspaper?"

"When you use it to clean the windows, the ink helps remove the dirt," Haruto explained.

[TL NOTE: Newspaper ink is typically oil-based, which can help polish glass.]

"Wow, that’s amazing! I want to try it too!" Ryota exclaimed. The boy was gradually warming up to Haruto, sticking close by and occasionally asking questions while he cleaned.

"Want to give it a go? Here, try wiping this part," Haruto said, handing the damp newspaper to Ryota and pointing to a section within the boy’s reach.

"Okay!" Ryota happily agreed.

As Haruto continued cleaning, Ikue, who had been working on her laptop in the living room, called out to him. "Sorry, Ootsuki-kun, for letting Ryota bother you like this."

"Not at all. Ryota-kun is actually helping me out," Haruto replied politely.

"See, Mom! I’m helping!" Ryota protested, pouting at his mother’s choice of words.

"Thanks to Ryota-kun, I’ll finish the window cleaning faster," Haruto added with a smile.

"Ehehe," Ryota giggled as Haruto gently patted his head.

"Oh my, it looks like Ryota has really taken a liking to you, Ootsuki-kun. It's almost like you’re real siblings," Ikue commented with a warm smile, turning to Ayaka. "Isn't that right, Ayaka?"

"Huh? Oh, yeah... I guess so," Ayaka replied absentmindedly. She had been resting her chin in her hand, watching Haruto clean without really thinking about it. Realizing she was being addressed, she snapped back to reality.

Noticing this, Ikue grinned mischievously. "Ayaka, are you sulking because Ryota is getting all of Ootsuki-kun’s attention? Or could it be..." she teased with a playful glint in her eyes.

"That you were actually admiring Ootsuki-kun?"

"Wha—!? M-Mom, what are you even talking about!?" Ayaka sputtered, jumping up from her chair, her face flushed as she glared at her mother.

"Oh, don’t get so worked up. Ah, youth~" Ikue teased further.

"Th-that's not it! It’s nothing like that!" Ayaka protested, her voice rising in pitch.

![Illustration}(https://files.catbox.moe/c906gw.jpg)

At Ayaka's outburst, Ryota, who was helping Haruto clean the windows, turned to look at his sister with a puzzled expression.

"Big sis, why is your face all red? Did you catch a cold?" he asked innocently.

"N-No, I'm not red! And no, I don’t have a cold! Ugh, just leave me alone!" Ayaka shouted, then hurriedly stormed out of the living room.

"Mom, what’s wrong with sis?" Ryota asked, bewildered as he stared at the door his sister had just rushed through. Ikue simply chuckled softly, a knowing smile on her lips.

"Your sister is just... enjoying life right now," she said with a playful tone.

"But she didn’t look like she was having fun just now," Ryota replied, tilting his head in confusion.

Ikue giggled again. "Oh, Ryota, it’s a bit too early for you to understand," she said, patting his head.

Still smiling, she turned her gaze back to Haruto, who was diligently wiping the windows beside them. "I’d be happy if spring finally came for my daughter..." she murmured to herself.

Her words were soft, filled with a mix of maternal warmth, a hint of longing, and a touch of hopeful joy. Haruto, focused on his cleaning, thought he might have caught a faint whisper of that heartfelt wish.
 
※

After finishing the window cleaning, Haruto moved on to clean the floors and the bathroom, spending a full hour tidying up the Tojo residence.

“Ikue-san, I've completed the cleaning. Is there anything else you need?” he reported politely.

“No, it’s perfect! Thank you so much for your hard work,” Ikue responded with a satisfied smile as she looked up from her laptop where she had been working in the living room.

“This is the first time I’ve been able to get so much work done at home! Normally, I lose so much time on chores like cleaning and laundry—it’s hard to focus,” she added with a grateful tone.

“I’m glad I could be of help. Now, regarding dinner, do you have any preferences for the menu?” Haruto inquired.

Ikue put a hand to her chin thoughtfully. “Hmm… well, it’s been so hot lately, so something light and refreshing would be nice. But, if possible, I’d like it to be filling as well,” she said, glancing at her younger son, Ryota, who was now sleeping soundly on the living room sofa.

Ryota had excitedly joined Haruto in cleaning earlier but, worn out from all the excitement, had dozed off midway. Haruto had gently carried him to the sofa to let him rest.

“Ryota-kun is at that age where he’s always hungry,” Haruto remarked.

“Exactly! For me, something like cold somen would be enough, but Ryota would complain for sure,” Ikue replied with a chuckle.

Haruto considered the options for a moment before suggesting, “How about a lemon-flavored cream pasta? The lemon’s acidity would make it refreshing, yet it’s still hearty.”

“Oh, that sounds lovely!” Ikue’s eyes lit up.

“Along with that, perhaps a cold potage soup and a Caprese salad would complement the meal nicely?”

“Such an elegant dinner! I love it!” she said enthusiastically. But then her expression turned slightly sheepish. “There’s just one problem... my fridge is pretty empty. Could I ask you to go grocery shopping as well?”

“Of course, that’s no problem,” Haruto assured her.

Shopping for ingredients was within the scope of his duties, so when he agreed, Ikue promptly handed him a thick envelope.

“Will this be enough?” she asked with a hint of concern.

Opening the envelope, Haruto found three crisp ten-thousand yen bills. He couldn’t help but think, Ah, so this is what it’s like to live among the wealthy.

“Yes, that amount is more than sufficient. Do you have any preferences for the store or specific ingredients?” he asked, knowing that some clients could be quite particular about where their groceries came from.

“Not really. Are you familiar with the nearby supermarket?”

“Yes, I know the location. I’ll head out now,” he said.

Just as Haruto was about to leave the living room, Ryota, who had been dozing on the sofa, suddenly sat up groggily.

“Huh...? Big bro, where are you going?” he asked, rubbing his eyes.

“I’m heading out to buy groceries for dinner,” Haruto explained.

“Groceries...?” Ryota blinked, still waking up. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, his eyes brightened. “I want to go too!”

He jumped off the sofa and hurried over to Haruto, eyes shining with excitement. It seemed the boy had grown quite attached to him during their time cleaning together.

“No, Ryota. Ootsuki-kun is going out for work, not for fun,” Ikue intervened gently.

“But I want to go shopping too!” Ryota pouted, tugging at his mother’s heartstrings.

Ikue looked slightly troubled. “I’m afraid I can’t let him take care of you while he’s working...”

“It’s really not a problem for me,” Haruto offered kindly. But Ikue, still concerned about imposing on him, hesitated. Then, an idea seemed to strike her.

“In that case, how about I have Ayaka accompany you two?” she suggested, her expression lighting up. With that, she stepped out of the living room and walked toward the staircase in the hallway.

“Ayaaaakaaa—! Can you come here for a moment?” she called up the stairs.

Ikue's voice called out a little louder this time.

Upstairs, Ayaka Tojo, who had retreated to her room after being teased by her mother earlier, heard her name being called.

“Ayakaaa!”

This time, the sound of a door opening echoed through the house, and Ayaka emerged into the hallway.

“...What?” she asked, sounding somewhat annoyed.

Ikue greeted her daughter's sullen demeanor with a cheerful smile. “Ryota insists on going with Ootsuki-kun for grocery shopping, but I can't let him go alone. So, could you go along and keep an eye on him?”

“Ugh...” Ayaka looked at her mother with a suspicious glare.

“There’s nothing suspicious about it, really!” Ikue laughed. “I just don’t want to burden Ootsuki-kun with looking after Ryota while he’s shopping, you know?”

“Well... I guess that makes sense,” Ayaka admitted reluctantly.

“Right? So, would you mind keeping Ryota company?” Ikue pressed with a hopeful smile.

“...Fine,” Ayaka finally agreed with a sigh, making Ikue's face light up with joy.

“Ryota, your sister will go with you, so you can join them for shopping.”

“Yaaayyy!!” Ryota cheered, throwing his hands in the air in excitement. He rushed over to his sister as she descended the stairs.

“Thank you, Ayaka! I love you, sis!!” he exclaimed.

“Yes, yes, I get it. Now hurry up and get ready if you’re coming,” Ayaka replied, her voice indifferent, though a faint smile tugged at her lips.

Turning to Haruto, she added, “Sorry, Ootsuki-kun, but I need a few minutes to get ready. Can you wait just a bit longer?”

“Of course, take your time,” Haruto replied kindly.

Ayaka quickly returned to her room to change into outdoor clothes, while Ryota, who had already changed, was eagerly waiting by the entrance, his shoes on and bouncing with impatience.

“Hurry up, sis! Come on, let’s go!!”

“Calm down, Ryota,” Ayaka said, trying to rein in her enthusiastic brother.

Watching the sibling dynamic unfold, Haruto couldn’t help but smile as he put on his shoes and reached for the front door.

“We’ll be heading out now.”

“Let’s go.”

“We’re off!!” Ryota shouted with glee.

All three of them called out their farewells in unison, and Ikue, who had come to see them off, waved with a warm smile. “Alright, be careful out there, especially with the cars!”

Together, they passed through the gate of the Tojo residence and headed toward the supermarket. Ryota was practically bouncing with excitement, thrilled to be going shopping with Haruto. Haruto, noticing how energetic Ryota was, decided to take precautionary measures.

“Ryota-kun, let’s hold hands until we get to the store, okay?” he suggested.

“Okay!!” Ryota agreed eagerly, reaching out to clasp Haruto’s hand with a big smile.

“Sorry for making you deal with Ryota’s whims,” Ayaka apologized, walking beside them.

“Not at all, it’s no trouble,” Haruto replied with a warm smile. As they walked, he occasionally lifted Ryota’s hand to let him swing playfully, which brought delighted giggles from the boy.

“You’re really kind, Ootsuki-kun,” Ayaka observed after watching him for a while.

“Eh? Do you think so?” Haruto replied, looking a bit embarrassed.

“Yeah, you are. You’ve been so patient with Ryota.”

“Well, maybe it’s because I’m an only child,” Haruto admitted, smiling softly as he hoisted Ryota onto his shoulders, making the boy squeal with joy. “Being with Ryota makes me feel like I have a little brother. I can’t help but feel happy—it’s like getting a sibling I never had.”

“He can be a brat and demanding sometimes, though,” Ayaka noted with a slight grin.

“Still, I think it’s great. When you’re an only child, you don’t even have anyone to argue with,” Haruto replied with a chuckle.

“Yeah, I guess that’s true.”

“What are you guys talking about?” Ryota, still riding on Haruto’s shoulders, leaned forward to look down at the two of them with a curious expression.

“Ryota and Ootsuki-kun seem like brothers, don’t they?” Ayaka remarked, prompting Ryota to hop off Haruto’s shoulders as they approached the supermarket.

“Okay, okay! I’ll get down now,” Ryota responded cheerfully.

“Hey, big brother! Will you give me another piggyback ride next time we go shopping?” Ryota asked eagerly.

“Sure, I’ll do it next time we come,” Haruto promised, and Ryota’s face lit up with joy.

This exchange made both Haruto and Ayaka smile. Soon, they arrived at the supermarket and began gathering the ingredients needed for dinner.

By the entrance, Ayaka turned to Haruto and asked, “So, Ootsuki-kun, what’s on the dinner menu today?”

“I’m thinking of making lemon-flavored cream pasta, chilled potge, a salad, and caprese,” Haruto replied.

“Oh, for the cream pasta, we’ll need milk and heavy cream, right?” Ayaka mused.

“Right, and some bacon too. Also, if there’s a good deal on any green vegetables, I’d like to add them for color,” Haruto added.

As they headed towards the vegetable section, Ryota, who had been listening to their conversation, ran over to the asparagus display.

“Big brother! These are only 98 yen per bunch! Isn’t that cheap?”

“Wow, that is a good deal! Good job, Ryota-kun,” Haruto praised, taking the asparagus from him. The asparagus, although on the thin side, was perfect for the pasta as it would easily mix with the noodles. Haruto patted Ryota on the head, and the boy beamed with pride.

“I’ll carry the basket, Ayaka-san,” Haruto offered.

“Oh, thanks,” Ayaka replied, handing him the basket. Haruto placed the asparagus inside, and Ayaka watched him intently.

“Hmm? Is something wrong?” Haruto asked, noticing her gaze.

“...Ootsuki-kun, do you have a girlfriend?” Ayaka suddenly asked.

“Eh? No, I don’t,” Haruto answered, confused by the unexpected question.

“I see... You were so natural about carrying the bags, so I thought maybe you were used to it,” Ayaka explained with a slight shrug.

“I’m currently working as a housekeeper, so I can’t very well let the customer, Ayaka-san, carry the bags,” Haruto added with a small smile.

“I see... You’re a housekeeper...,” Ayaka murmured, nodding in understanding.

“Yeah. Oh, look, this pumpkin is on sale. Let’s use it for the chilled potage,” Haruto said, moving towards the pumpkin section while talking to Ryota.

Ayaka watched him quietly, noticing how gentle he was with the boy. Haruto’s kind expressions made her unconsciously focus on him, and it didn’t take long before he turned to her again.

“If we buy a whole pumpkin, we can freeze the seeds for later. Should we buy the whole one?” he asked.

“...Eh? Oh, yeah, I think that’s fine,” Ayaka replied, initially confused but quickly snapping back to the conversation and nodding.

“Got it. Next, we need tomatoes. Ryota-kun, want to go look at the tomatoes?” Haruto asked, smiling down at Ryota.

“Yeah! Tomatoes!” Ryota exclaimed excitedly, and Haruto held his hand as they walked toward the tomato section.

Ayaka followed a step behind, trying to keep up with them. As they continued shopping, Haruto couldn’t help but notice that Ayaka, known as the school’s idol, was attracting a lot of attention. People passing by kept sneaking glances at her, and Haruto began to feel the pressure of those eyes, even though they were mostly directed at Ayaka.

Concerned, Haruto glanced at Ayaka, but she didn’t seem fazed by the attention. It seemed like she was used to it, even though it was clear from the subtle tension in her shoulders that she didn’t exactly enjoy it.

After they finished shopping for all the necessary ingredients, they left the store. Haruto let out a quiet sigh of relief. Although most of the attention had been on Ayaka, he noticed a few people giving him jealous or resentful looks.

“It’s tough for you, Ayaka-san, when there are so many people around, huh?” Haruto said sympathetically.

“Eh? Oh, yeah, it’s a bit annoying sometimes. I’ve gotten used to it, but it doesn’t feel great,” Ayaka answered, her tone a bit wry.

“There are times when it feels like people are staring at me... in a really creepy way,” she admitted with a slight shudder.

“Ah, I see. I guess being too cute can be tough, huh?” Haruto said with a teasing smile.

“C-cute!?!” Ayaka stopped suddenly, eyes wide with shock.

“Eh? What’s wrong?” Haruto asked, noticing her sudden pause.

“N-nothing!” Ayaka quickly looked away, her face turning red as she hastily walked ahead, trying to cover her embarrassment.

From behind her, Ryota, still holding her hand, looked up at his sister and asked innocently, “Sis? Your face is all red.”

“Ah!? It’s just because it’s hot! Let’s hurry home!” Ayaka stammered, trying to avoid his gaze and quickening her pace to get home.

After finishing their shopping at the supermarket, Haruto and the others return home.  
Holding an eco-bag in one hand, Haruto enters the dining room, only to find an unfamiliar man sitting at the dining table.  

"Welcome home. You must be the housekeeper, Ootsuki-kun?"  

"Ah, yes. Um..."  

Haruto, a bit startled by the man, responds with a slight pause. Meanwhile, Ryota runs past him and rushes toward the man.  

"Dad, welcome home!"

"Welcome back, Ryota! Did you have fun shopping?"  

The man, who seems to be Ryota's father, lifts him up and asks with a smile. Haruto straightens up and bows politely.  

"Nice to meet you. I am Ootsuki, the housekeeper."  

"Thank you for your work. I am Ryota and Ayaka's father."  

Still holding Ryota, Mr. Tojo gives a small bow.  

"You came back early today, Dad."  

Ayaka, following them into the dining room, comments.  

"Well, today is the day Ootsuki-kun is here to help with the housekeeping, so I wrapped up work early."  

Tojo-san says this while looking at Haruto with an expectant gaze.  

"I hear you're making cream pasta today. The hamburger last time was excellent, so I'm looking forward to this one."  

"Thank you very much. I will do my best to meet your expectations."  

Haruto smiles modestly, feeling a bit embarrassed as he heads to the kitchen to start preparing dinner.  

First, he cuts the pumpkin for the potage and puts it in the oven. While it's cooking, he prepares the asparagus for the pasta by salting and massaging it. Afterward, he slices tomatoes for the caprese salad and puts them in the fridge. As he works, Haruto moves with no hesitation, skillfully progressing with the cooking. Ikue, impressed by his efficiency, remarks,  

"You're really good at this! A guy cooking food is so charming!"  

Tojo-san, sitting next to her, nods in agreement.  

"Watching Ootsuki-kun cook is like watching a seasoned chef. I can’t help but be drawn in."  

"Thank you very much. I'm really happy to hear that. I'll do my best to ensure the taste lives up to your expectations."  

Haruto, while quickly mashing the microwave-heated pumpkin, lowers his head with a slightly bashful smile.  

"Hmm, I never imagined that one of Ayaka's classmates would be someone as wonderful as you."  

Tojo-san, clearly impressed with Haruto's demeanor and his work as a housekeeper, turns to ask his daughter,  

"Ayaka, are you close with Ootsuki-kun?"  

"...Eh? Well, not really..."  

Ayaka's response causes Mr. Tojo to look between her and Haruto with a serious expression.  

"Really? Until we asked Ootsuki-kun to help with housekeeping, you hardly talked to him, huh?"

"Well, that's right," Ayaka says, offering a brief explanation.  

"I see."  

He looks back at Haruto.  

"But Ootsuki-kun seems very sincere and reliable. I hope you and my daughter can get along well from now on."  

"Wait a minute! Dad!"  

Ayaka, flustered by her father's comment, quickly turns to Haruto with an apologetic expression.  

"I'm sorry, Ootsuki-kun. My dad said something weird."  

"No, no. It's fine. Well, it’s funny how I ended up being called here for housework at your house. As dad said, I hope we can get along and be friends from now on."  

"Eh? Oh, yeah! S-sure."  

Ayaka, surprised by Haruto’s words, smiles slightly, not entirely opposed to the idea. Their interaction makes Mr. Tojo clear his throat.  

"Ahem! Ootsuki-kun, I'm happy that you'll get along with my daughter, but... there’s no reason for you to call me 'Dad'!!"  

With a dramatic flair, Tojo-san says this with a firm tone.  

"Ah, no! I’m so sorry!!"  

Haruto quickly bows his head, apologizing in a panic.  

"Ahh, haha! I was just joking!"  

Tojo-san laughs heartily, saying, "I've always wanted to say that at least once in my life."  

"...I’m relieved."  

"Ugh... Dad, you’re the worst."  

Haruto breathes a sigh of relief, while Ayaka glares at her father with an annoyed look, muttering under her breath.  

Despite Tojo-san's joke, Haruto forced a strained smile but didn’t stop preparing dinner.

Just then, Ryota, who had been playing with his mother, ran up to him.

"Hey, big brother."

"Hmm? What’s up, Ryota-kun?"

"Won’t you eat dinner with us?"

Looking up at Haruto with innocent eyes, Ryota made Haruto hesitate.

Haruto’s contract as a housekeeper was from 3 PM to 6 PM. Therefore, if he were to have dinner with the Tojo family, it would exceed his contract hours.

Haruto didn’t mind staying, but the Tojo family might find it troublesome if he overstayed his welcome.

Thinking this, Haruto was about to say, "I can’t have dinner with you," but before he could, Tojo’s father spoke.

"That’s fine! How about it, Haruto-kun? If it’s not too much trouble, why don’t you stay and have dinner with us?"

With Tojo’s father completely eager, Haruto was left confused.

"I’m not bothered at all, but I’m here for work, so…"

Haruto stammered, and Ikue, smiling gently, chimed in.

"Oh, come on, Haruto-kun, I told you before, right? You’re Ayaka’s classmate, so feel free to relax."

"But… won’t this be awkward for you, Tojo-san?"

"Not at all!"  

"I’m fine with it!"  

Both Tojo’s father and daughter responded simultaneously. Since they were both "Tojo," it was expected.

After their voices overlapped, Tojo’s father looked at his daughter and laughed.

"Haruto-kun, with the way you’re calling us, no one would know who’s who. After all, we’re all Tojos here."

Tojo’s father said this with a slightly mischievous expression.

"By the way, my name is Shuichi. Calling me Tojo-san might get confusing, so I’d be happy if you called me by my name from now on."

Though confused by this request, Haruto complied.

"Um, understood, Shuichi-san."

Shuichi nodded in satisfaction at Haruto’s response.

"Well then… is it okay if I have dinner with you, Shuichi-san?"

"Of course, of course!"

Shuichi answered immediately, and Haruto smiled wryly.

"Tojo-san— ah… Is it okay if I call you Ayaka-san too?"

Haruto almost said "Tojo-san" again to Ayaka but switched to her name when he saw the amused twitch of Shuichi’s eyebrow.

"Uh, yeah. I’m fine with it."

Not used to being called by a boy’s first name, Ayaka blushed slightly as she answered.

Indeed, at school, Ayaka was always surrounded by girls, and Haruto had rarely seen her interact with boys. Even if he did, it was only about school-related matters, and in such cases, no boy in Haruto’s school ever called her by her first name.

It seemed that, with the approval of her parents, Haruto was now going to call her by her first name.

Feeling a mix of joy, embarrassment, and awkwardness, Haruto had complicated emotions in his chest. Meanwhile, Ryota gave him an innocent and pure smile.

"Are you going to have dinner with us today, big brother?"

From the flow of the conversation, Ryota had somehow figured out that Haruto would be joining them for dinner. He lightly tugged at Haruto’s sleeve, smiling widely.

Feeling defeated by Ryota’s bright smile, Haruto squatted down and patted his head as he said:

"Yeah. Today, I’ll have dinner with you, Ryota-kun."

"Yayyy!!"

"Alright, just wait a little longer until the food’s ready."

"Okay!"

Ryota nodded enthusiastically and ran back to his mother in the living room.

Having been healed by Ryota’s smile, Haruto was now determined to make the best dinner for the Tojo family.

Tonight’s menu consisted of lemon-flavored cream pasta, chilled pumpkin soup, and Caprese. It was a light meal perfect for the hot summer nights.

Haruto quickly mashed the smooth pumpkin after it was strained, added milk and cream, and mixed it before putting it back in the fridge to chill. He then placed the pasta into a pot of boiling water and, in the meantime, sautéed bacon and asparagus in olive oil.

The delicious aroma of the crispy bacon and the elegant scent of olive oil began to waft from the kitchen, and Shuichi relaxed his expression.

"Haruto-kun, who taught you how to cook?"

"I learned from my grandmother. Not just cooking, but cleaning, laundry, and all household chores, they were all taught to me by her."

"Ah, I see. It seems your grandmother is a truly wonderful person, Haruto-kun."

"Thank you very much."

Haruto bowed his head to Shuichi.

For Haruto, his grandmother was his mentor in all things related to household chores, so when she was praised, Haruto, as her pupil, naturally smiled.

After a short while, Haruto finished all the preparations and laid out dinner for five people on the dining table.

"My, my! This feels like we’ve come to an Italian restaurant!" Ikue smiled as she looked at the dishes arranged on the table.

"Thank you, Haruto-kun. Now, let’s all eat."

At Shuichi’s words, the Tojo family took their seats at the table, and Haruto joined them, though a little hesitantly.

"Well then, let’s eat."

Shuichi said, putting his hands together, and everyone followed with "Itadakimasu."

Afterward, Ryota grabbed his fork at an incredible speed and immediately started twirling the cream pasta.

"It’s delicious!! Big brother! This is soooo good!!"

"Ryota, Ryota. Eat slowly, or you’ll choke."

Ikue warned Ryota, who was eating the pasta at the speed of someone drinking a beverage. However, her words didn’t reach Ryota, who was engrossed in the pasta. His plate was already nearly empty.

It hadn’t even been three minutes since he started eating, and Ryota was almost finished. Haruto, the one who made it, smiled.

"Ryota-kun, I’ve prepared some extra, so you can eat slowly and still have more."

"Really!? I want seconds!!"

Ryota’s eyes lit up at Haruto’s words. At that moment, Ayaka, looking at her little brother’s plate, scolded him.

"Not so fast, Ryota. If you want more, make sure to finish what’s on your plate properly first."

"Ah, okay!"

At his sister’s scolding, Ryota hurriedly scooped up the remaining pasta with his fork. Haruto watched him with a smile, and just then, he heard a tentative voice from beside him.

"Haruto-kun, um… is there any extra food?"

Looking over at the voice’s owner, Shuichi, Haruto saw that his plate was already completely empty. It seemed that Shuichi had finished before Ryota.

"Yes, no problem."

"I see! Well, I’ll have some seconds then."

"Ah! Dad, that’s not fair! I want seconds too!!"

Having cleaned his plate according to his sister’s orders, Ryota eagerly grabbed his empty plate and handed it to Haruto, determined not to lose to his father.

With both Tojo father and son requesting more, Haruto smiled wryly and took their plates to the kitchen. Thinking it was a good idea to make extra for Ryota, Haruto quickly refilled the plates.

When Haruto brought back seconds for Ryota and Shuichi, both of their faces lit up with excitement.

As expected from father and son, their reactions were identical. Haruto was impressed, and for a moment, he couldn’t help but think of them as a little like dogs. Shuichi was like a golden retriever, while Ryota was more like a small Shiba Inu. Imagining them both wagging their tails excitedly in front of their food made Haruto nearly grin, but he bit his lip to hold it back.

"Hehehe, even you two are so eager. What a sight," Ikue said, amused by the men’s reactions.

"This flavor is just like something from a high-end restaurant. Don’t you agree, Mom?"

"Yes, this soup is so smooth, and the seasoning is perfect. It’s delicious."

"Thank you. I’m glad it suits your taste."

Haruto replied politely, and Ikue asked with curiosity:

"Hey, Haruto-kun. What’s your specialty dish?"

Both Shuichi and Ayaka showed interest and looked at him, waiting for an answer.

Ryota, on the other hand, seemed to have tuned out everything around him, fully absorbed in his food.

"Well… I’d say my hamburgers are a specialty of mine, but..."

Haruto could cook a variety of cuisines, both Western and Eastern, but since his grandmother was particularly skilled at Japanese cooking, Haruto’s favorite and most frequent dishes were also Japanese.

"I think I’m pretty good at making things like nikujaga or chikuzenni."

Both of those were dishes his grandmother had often made when he was little, so they were especially familiar to him.

"I’d love to try your nikujaga sometime, Haruto-kun..."

"Oh my, Ayaka, has Haruto-kun captured your heart with his cooking?"

"Wha— M-Mom! Don’t say weird things!"

"Hehehe, sorry, sorry."

"Geez..."

At her mother's teasing words, Ayaka puffed out her lips.

"However, I must say, I’d love to try more of Haruto-kun’s cooking in the future."

"Yes, I agree with you," Ikue said, nodding in agreement with Shuichi.

"Well then, Haruto-kun," Shuichi said, turning seriously toward Haruto. He then took a sheet of paper from the shelf behind the dining table and placed it on the table in front of Haruto, so he could see it clearly.

"This is a flyer for a regular contract..."

"Yes, we are very satisfied with your housework. So, from now on, we’d like to sign a regular contract for housework with you, Haruto-kun, as our designated person."

Haruto’s expression was one of surprise at Shuichi’s words.

"Uh... um, thank you. I’m really happy."

"No, no! The one who should be thanking you is us," Shuichi said with a smile.

"Yes, that’s right. We’ll be counting on you from now on," Ikue added, also smiling.

Haruto glanced over at Ayaka, slightly unsure, and she, too, looked at him from slightly lowered eyes before speaking.

"Take care of us, Haruto-kun."

"Y-yes, I’ll do my best," Haruto said, bowing with some hesitation.

It was completely unexpected for him to be offered a regular contract for housework while working a short-term part-time job. What started as a casual job to help fund his college education had unexpectedly led to being liked by the family of the school’s idol, and now he would be coming to their house during the summer vacation.

It was such an unforeseen turn of events that Haruto momentarily lost his train of thought and wiped the creamy soup from Ryota’s mouth, which had formed a "moustache."
