 The day after signing the regular contract with the Tojo family for housework services.

On a midsummer early morning when the sky had just begun to lighten.

Haruto was sitting at his desk, feeling the soft breeze blowing in from the window, with reference books spread out on the desk and a pen moving across his notebook.

Even though the midsummer days were relentlessly hot with the sun glaring down, the early morning hours were still somewhat cool. Since the air conditioner in his room was not working well, Haruto often studied at this time.

Under the quiet dawn sky, wrapped in stillness, Haruto was diligently studying with a serious expression. However, he suddenly heard the chirping of a bird and turned his gaze toward the window.

"I really signed the regular contract, huh..."

What came to Haruto's mind was the events from the previous day at the Tojo house.

Ikue, happy to see the house cleaned after the chores were done. Shuichi and Ryota, eating the food with delight. And Ayaka, shyly yet slightly happily saying, "Thank you, Otsuki-kun."

Remembering the satisfied expressions of the Tojo family members with the housework Haruto had done, his face naturally broke into a smile.

"Housework services... is pretty rewarding."

Looking up at the sky through the window as the evening dusk was being pushed up by the horizon's light, Haruto muttered to himself.

After a while, Haruto, who had been diligently studying, sensed movement downstairs. He stopped his pen, closed the reference book, and stood up.

"Has grandma woken up? Guess it's time to start preparing breakfast."

He placed the pen down and stretched with a big yawn, then left his room and headed toward the kitchen on the first floor.

"Good morning, Haruto."

"Good morning, grandma."

In the kitchen, his grandmother was already making tamagoyaki (Japanese omelette). Haruto stood beside her, heating up the stock he had prepared the day before.

"Were you studying again from the morning?"

His grandmother, after finishing the tamagoyaki and transferring it to a plate, asked.

"Yeah, a student's primary duty is studying, after all."

"Don't overwork yourself too much, okay?"

"I'm fine."

While replying to his grandmother, Haruto added the chopped green onions to the stock. After that, he opened the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator.

"Grandma, can I use this spinach?"

"Sure, go ahead."

After receiving his grandmother's permission, Haruto took two bundles of spinach from the vegetable compartment and also grabbed some tofu. While the electric kettle was boiling water, Haruto cut the tofu and added it to the stock. Once it lightly started boiling, he turned off the heat and dissolved the miso in it.

"By the way, Haruto, how's the part-time job going? Are you doing okay?"

"Perfectly. It's thanks to all the things you've taught me, grandma."

"Is that so, that's good to hear."

Grandma smiled brightly as she poured the hot water from the kettle into a pot, set it on the stove, and lightly boiled the spinach.

"On my first day of the part-time job, I made your secret hamburger, grandma, and they said it was like something from a high-end restaurant."

As Haruto served the freshly cooked rice into a bowl, he said a little proudly.

"Well, well, that's great to hear."

"It's all thanks to you, grandma. Thank you. Oh, I'll handle cooling the spinach."

Haruto transferred the spinach, which had turned a nice color, from the pot to a colander and rinsed it under cold water. Meanwhile, his grandmother poured the completed miso soup into bowls, placed the rice and side dishes onto a tray, and took them to the living room table. Haruto also squeezed the excess water from the spinach, cut it with a knife, quickly drizzled some white stock over it, and topped it with bonito flakes and ground sesame seeds.

"Alright, breakfast is ready."

Haruto transferred the spinach dish to a small plate, brought it to the living room table, and sat down.

"Well, let's eat."

"Yeah, let's eat."

The two of them put their hands together and began their breakfast. Haruto first reached for the tamagoyaki his grandmother had made.

"This tamagoyaki is so delicious, grandma. How is it so tasty? What’s different between mine and yours?"

"Yours is delicious too, Haruto."

"No, my tamagoyaki is still far from being anywhere near as good as yours..."

After taking a bite, Haruto stared intently at the tamagoyaki, lost in thought. Seeing her grandson's expression, his grandmother squinted her eyes and smiled softly.

"By the way, Haruto, haven't you gotten a girlfriend yet?"

"?! Ah, what... well..."

At his grandmother's sudden question, Haruto almost dropped the tamagoyaki he had been holding with his chopsticks.

"I see... Haruto, you're already in your second year of high school, right? Isn't it normal to have a girlfriend by now?"

"No, no, no! That's not normal! At my school, there are way more people who don't have a girlfriend than those who do!"

"Is that how it is?"

Haruto's grandmother looked slightly worried after hearing his words. Seeing her expression, Haruto felt a sense of sadness as if his chest was being pressed down.

Lately, his grandmother’s health had been deteriorating, particularly her lower back. And now, she was concerned about whether Haruto had a girlfriend. Haruto could sense the reason behind her concern, and though he felt like he might be overwhelmed by it, he fought back the urge and forced a smile.

"That’s how it is! Things are completely different now compared to your time."

Making an effort to speak cheerfully, Haruto continued.

"And besides, even if I had a girlfriend now, that doesn’t mean I’d marry her. I’m only seventeen, you know?"

"Well, that's true..."

"Exactly! So don't worry, grandma. Someday, I'll definitely introduce you to an incredibly cute girlfriend!"

Haruto proudly declared this to his grandmother, the only family he had.

"Is that so? Well then, I'll look forward to it."

Upon hearing her grandson's declaration, his grandmother smiled gently.

※

The sun had just begun to rise, and although it hinted at the intense heat of the day to come, the summer morning was still cool enough to be comfortable. As people out for a morning jog passed by, Haruto walked slowly through the quiet residential area.

"A girlfriend, huh..." Haruto thought back to his conversation with his grandmother during breakfast.

Considering her age and the length of time she had left to live, it was natural for her to worry about her grandson. Understanding this, Haruto let out a short sigh.

If he could introduce her to a girlfriend, his grandmother would surely be very happy. Haruto also wanted to see her happy and wanted to reassure her.

"But..." Haruto found it difficult to imagine a life with a girlfriend at this point. Right now, he was busy with studying, his part-time job doing housework, and his karate lessons— his days were already full.

"I don’t have time to make a girlfriend..." he muttered to himself.

Suddenly, a girl’s smiling face appeared in his mind. It was the smile of the most popular girl at his school, known for being the prettiest.

"No way, no way. I don’t want to join the ranks of the guys who fell for her like Kaito-senpai."

Haruto shook his head, trying to erase the image of the girl smiling in his mind.

Before long, Haruto reached his destination. In front of him was a gate with a glossy wooden sign that read, "Dojima Dojo - Kyokushin Karate."

Haruto passed through the traditional gate and entered the dojo.

The wooden floors were lined with scrolls displaying the dojo's principles, such as "Heart, Technique, Body" and "Begin and End with Courtesy." Taking a deep breath, Haruto inhaled the wooden scent that mixed with the faint smell of sweat, and a smile naturally appeared on his face. Thanks to his grandfather's teaching methods, Haruto had been coming to this dojo since childhood. It was a place he considered his second home.

"Good morning!" Haruto entered the dojo and bowed.

A large man called out to him.

"Yo, Haruto, good morning! You’re here today, huh? It’s boring when you’re not here to spar with."

"Good morning, Kaz-senpai."

The man who greeted him was a towering figure, nearly two meters tall, with short hair and three lines shaved into the sides. His sharp eyes were accentuated by his thin eyebrows, and he had a scar running from his temple to his mouth. Anyone who didn’t know him would likely assume he was part of the underworld. The scar on his face made even those who had survived many dangerous situations hesitate and check if their pinky finger was still attached.

However, Haruto knew the truth.

His hobby was baking, and the scar on his face had actually come from playing with a stray cat. Recently, his biggest concern was that, despite loving children, they would start crying the moment they made eye contact with him.

Haruto had once spent over an hour comforting and cheering him up over this issue.

"When it’s sparring time, everyone avoids me," Kaz complained.

"Well, your reputation, Ishigura Kazuki, is pretty well known around here," Haruto teased.

"Hey, you! Don’t go spreading my name like that!" Kaz retorted, giving Haruto a headlock.

Haruto quickly apologized, but a smile was on his face as he said, "Sorry, sorry."

Kaz, still holding the headlock, seemed to be enjoying himself as he pressed his fist against Haruto’s head.

Kaz, one year older than Haruto, had been training at the dojo since childhood, just like Haruto. He was a dependable older brother figure to Haruto, and Haruto was like a beloved younger brother to him. The two of them also served as the assistant instructors of the dojo, and despite being evenly matched in skill, they pushed each other to improve through friendly rivalry.

As the two of them continued to play around at the entrance of the dojo, a flat voice called out from behind them.

"Kaz-senpai, Haru-senpai, please stop fooling around at the entrance. You’re blocking the way."

The two turned toward the voice and saw a young girl standing at the entrance with a completely expressionless face.

"Hey, hey, what’s up, Shizuku? Are you jealous because I’m spending time with Haru-senpai?" Kaz teased in a playful tone.

"Yes, I’m jealous. So please hurry up and get away," Shizuku replied, still with her blank expression, speaking in a calm tone as she glared at Kaz.

Kaz, upon being glared at, immediately released Haruto and raised his hands in mock surrender. Then, exaggeratingly, he shook his body as if shivering.

"Ooh, scary. As expected from the only daughter of the Dojima dojo. You’ve got quite the presence."

"I don’t like being called 'having presence.' It makes me sound old. I’m a vibrant, energetic high school girl, you know!"

With a serious (expressionless) face, the girl says something playful, and Haruto responds in disbelief.

"How about saying you're 'pichi-pichi' and 'kyu-kyu' yourself?"

Haruto couldn't help but retort. The girl turns her gaze towards him.

"Then, how would you describe my completely flawless beauty, Haru-senpai?"

"Well, I think saying 'completely flawless beauty' is a bit much… but, yeah. Shizuku's cuteness is more on the traditional side, so if I had to say, maybe 'Yamato Nadeshiko'?"

[TL NOTE: A Yamato Nadeshiko is the stereotypical perfect Japanese woman. She is soft-spoken, mild-mannered, an excellent housekeeper, and a wonderful cook.]

Haruto says after quickly scanning the girl's appearance.

The girl, who has been saying playful things with a lack of expression, is Shizuku Dojima. She is the daughter of one of the masters of this dojo.

Haruto, Ishigura, and Shizuku have been dojo mates since they were young, and Shizuku is also a junior at the same high school as Haruto.

At the high school Haruto attends, the girl who has overwhelming and absolute popularity among the boys is his classmate, Ayaka Tojo, who recently got involved with him through part-time work. However, the girl in front of him, Shizuku Dojima, also enjoys high popularity, especially among the first-year boys of the same grade.

Shizuku, a beautiful girl with short black hair, raises an eyebrow at Haruto's words, "Yamato Nadeshiko."

"Are you saying that to flirt with me, Haru-senpai? Hah... I guess I have no choice but to let you flirt with me. You should be grateful."

"No, I'm not flirting with you even a little bit. And seriously, when you make jokes like that, at least stop keeping a straight face."

Haruto sighs as he talks to his expressionless junior. Shizuku then pouts her lips, still expressionless.

"Haru-senpai, you're such a tease~"

"I told you to stop with the straight face."

"Hahaha! Shizuku, that funny face is the best!"

Haruto holds his head in exasperation at his ever-playful junior, and Ishigura laughs loudly at their exchange.

The faint sense of solemnity Haruto had felt in the morning was completely gone, replaced by the unchanged dynamic between the three of them.

After sweating it out in the dojo until nearly noon, Haruto changes out of his gi and into casual clothes to head home. As he's finishing changing, Ishigura calls out to him.

"Haruto, there's something I want to ask you."

In his hand, Ishigura holds a white cardboard box, typically used for cakes.

"Huh? What's up?"

"Well, it's about this... Oh, Shizuku! Come here for a sec."

Ishigura stops Shizuku, who is passing by.

"What is it, Kaz-senpai? A confession of love? Sorry, but I'm devoted to Haru-senpai."

Shizuku says with a carefree expression, and Haruto gives her a wry smile.

"If you said it with a little more bashfulness, maybe I'd be more moved, but when you say it so matter-of-factly with a straight face like that, it's hard to feel anything."

Haruto sighs as he speaks, and Shizuku tilts her body slightly, cocking her head and looking up at Haruto with a mischievous expression.

"How about now? Does it move you? Have I captivated you?"

"...Shizuku, before doing poses like that, you should work on training your facial muscles."

"Haru-senpai, you can't be satisfied unless you make a woman conform to your liking, huh? What a troublesome person."

"Hey, you two. Stop with the skits and listen to my request."

Ishigura interrupts Haruto and Shizuku’s conversation with a disapproving look. Haruto turns to him with a serious face.

"If it's a request from Kaz-senpai, I'll do anything. So, which group are we taking down this time?"

"Anything you say, young master."

Shizuku enthusiastically joins in on Haruto's playful mood.

Though she often gets misunderstood because of her expressionless face, she's actually quite a playful person, and she always goes along with Haruto's jokes like this.

"You guys... seriously, knock it off."

Ishigura glares at the two juniors, trying to look intimidating. If someone didn't know him, they'd probably think he'd scare children or even adults with his intense gaze. However, Haruto and Shizuku, who have known him for a long time, brush off his glare without a second thought. In fact, Shizuku even teases Ishigura more.

"Hey Kaz-senpai, the number one scary guy in Japan!"

"Who’s scary?! Hah... well, whatever. For now, just eat this."

Ishigura takes out a mini-sized fruit tart from the box he was holding.

"Huh? Can we eat this?"

"Kaz-senpai, I'm not the kind of cheap girl who can be bought with something like this, you know?"

"Come on, try it. Wait, Shizuku, you're already eating it! What a cheap girl!"

While Shizuku munches on the fruit tart with shining eyes next to him, Haruto picks one up and takes a bite.

"!? This is insanely delicious! Where did you buy this from?"

Haruto's eyes widen in surprise at the taste. The rich custard cream has a solid sweetness, and when it enters his mouth, the rich flavor of eggs fills his senses, spreading up his nose. Then, the slight tartness of the fruit cleanses the cream’s sweetness, leaving a refreshing aftertaste. The crisp texture of the tart crust adds a great accent, and Haruto finishes it in no time.

When he looks over, Shizuku is already about to finish her second one.

"Is there a cake shop around here that sells fruit tarts like this?"

"Ah, actually... I made this."

"Huh?"

"Guuh!!"

At Ishigura's shocking revelation, Haruto's mouth drops open, and Shizuku almost chokes on her third fruit tart.

"Huh!? Seriously!? You made this, Kaz-senpai?"

"The guy with a face so scary he could turn sugar into salt made this... this...?"

"I don't have a scary face, and I don't have any special abilities!!"

Ishigura's angry response comes after his disrespectful juniors' reactions.

"No, but Kaz-senpai, this is really good. The quality is high enough that it could be sold in a store."

"Oh, really? Is it that good?"

Haruto's comment makes Ishigura’s anger dissipate in an instant.

"Yeah, this is good enough to open a shop. Let’s name it 'Gap of Lightning 893.'"

"Alright, Shizuku, how about we spar?"

"Ah, I need to help out at home."

To escape from Ishigura’s approach, Shizuku quickly runs into her house, which is next to the dojo.

"She’d be so cute if she just stayed quiet... what a waste."

"Well, that’s Shizuku for you. If she suddenly became quiet and stopped joking around, that’d be a bit scary too."

"True."

Haruto’s opinion is one Ishigura agrees with.

"By the way, Kaz-senpai’s fruit tart was amazing. When did you get so good at making sweets?"

Haruto knows that Ishigura's hobby is making sweets, and he already knows that his sweets are usually delicious. However, today's tart seems to have a much higher quality than before.

"Well, in this day and age, you can find recipes online anytime, and you can watch videos too, right? So, I started seriously studying how to make sweets."

"Wow, that’s impressive. Teach me how to make sweets sometime. I don’t have much experience with western-style sweets."

"Sure, let’s make a cake together next time."

"That sounds great. Oh, I need to go now. I have work."

Haruto looks at the clock hanging on the dojo wall and says,

"Right, today I start the house cleaning job for the Tojo family."

"I see, Haruto, you started a part-time job over the summer, huh?"

"Yeah, that’s right. Well, I’ll see you later, Kaz-senpai."

"Good luck with your job."

Haruto says goodbye to Ishigura and leaves the dojo.

After returning home briefly, Haruto prepares for the house cleaning job and heads to the Tojo family’s house. On the way there, Haruto reflects on the fruit tart Ishigura made earlier.

"Ryota-kun would probably be happy if I made him a tart like that."

Imagining Ryota’s innocent smile, Haruto lifts the corners of his mouth.

"I’m confident I can make good chawanmushi and ohagi, but western-style sweets are still a bit tricky."

Though Haruto knows the basic way to make cakes, he understands that making sweets delicious isn’t as simple as just knowing the method.

"They were so sweet when I ate them."

Haruto mutters these trivial thoughts as he heads to the Tojo family’s house.
